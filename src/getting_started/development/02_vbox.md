# VirtualBox Guide

---

VirtualBox (VBox) is a popular hypervisor[^hypervisor] for x86
virtualisation. It allows you to create **virtual machines**, which are
effectively emulations of computers on your computer. This allows you 
to use operating systems you do not have on disk, run programs that may
be risky to run on your computer, or work with historical machines
that are hard to find now. 

We will use VirtualBox to create a virtual machine (VM) to contribute
to the **NYU Processor Design Team** without having to install
Linux natively or buy a new computer. VBox is a plug-and-play
solution for all intents and purposes of the **NYU Processor 
Design Team**.

This guide will help you use the provided VM configuration with VBox.

## Minimum Requirements
- **CPU:** Any reasonably powerful 64-bit x86 processor  
  (fancy way to say "most modern computers")

- **Memory:** 8 GB RAM  
  (the VM uses 4 GB)

- **Disk Space:** 16 GB available space  
  (Virtual hard disks are dynamic and grow with usage. You do not 
  *need* 16 GB available immediately, that's just what the VM is set 
  up for)

- **OS:** Any major 64-bit operating system such as Windows, 
          macOS, and most Linux distributions


**Note:** If you already use Linux or macOS, you can start working
immediately and do not need a VM, but nobody will stop you if 
you wish to use one regardless. Check the [Lab Guidance](../onboarding/01_guidance.md) 
page for what you need to have. Optionally, macOS users are
encouraged to look at the [Homebrew Installation Guide](01_homebrew.md).

## Virtual Machine Information
- The provided VM is set up for VirtualBox >7.0.0, which means it is
  guaranteed to work with any version of VBox after 7.0.0

- Currently, VirtualBox is on 7.0.1, as of writing this guide

- The VM is set up with [Ubuntu Desktop 22.04.1 LTS](https://releases.ubuntu.com/22.04/)

- The VM contains all tools you need to begin working *right away*

### Specifications
- **OS:** Ubuntu Desktop 22.04.1 LTS[^lts]

- **Processors:** 2 processors

- **Memory:** 4 GB RAM

- **Disk Space:** 16 GB

- **Appliance Size[^appliance]:** 7 GB

**Note:** You can edit these later to your desire if your computer has more
          resources to allocate to the VM.

## Downloading VirtualBox
1. Go to [virtualbox.org](https://www.virtualbox.org)

2. Download the latest version of VirtualBox

## Downloading the VM
1. Go [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vzB0ra_1gFrapqpwCEHLpuZI6Ekn0mpw?usp=share_link)

2. Download the `.ova` file
   - OVA stands for Open Virtualisation Appliance
   - It is a common file extension that hypervisors use
   - The **NYU Processor Design Team** VM contains the *entire*
     OS, some applications, utilities, etc. and therefore, is ~7 GB.

## Importing the VM
1. Open VBox
  
2. Click on "File" and then "Import Appliance"
<img src="/images/vbox/import1.png" width="50%" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"/>

3. Find the `procezzor.ova` file in your file system
<img src="/images/vbox/import2.png" width="90%" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"/>

4. Click <button>Next</Button>

5. Keep all the default options, click <button>Next</button>

## Starting the VM
- Double-click on the VM or press <button>Start</button>
<img src="/images/vbox/start.png" width="80%" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"/>

## Logging In
- You will now be presented with a log-in screen like this:
<img src="/images/vbox/login1.png" width="80%" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"/>

- Click on the "designer" user and you will see this:
<img src="/images/vbox/login2.png" width="80%" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"/>

- Enter the password "processor" and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>/<kbd>Return</kbd>

- You will now be presented with the Ubuntu homescreen
<img src="/images/vbox/login3.png" width="80%" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"/>

## Homescreen
- You will see the home folder on the Desktop, in the top-right corner

- On the dock, you will see:
  - Files (the file explorer)
  - Firefox (browser)
  - VS Code (text editor) with some useful extensions:
    - C/C++
    - CMake and CMake Tools
    - GitLens
    - System Verilog Language Server
  - Terminal
  - Recycle Bin

## Exploring your VM and Tips
- Now you have a Linux VM to play around with

- You can do whatever you want with it
  - Since this is not a real computer, you do not have to
    worry about breaking it so play around
  - Worst case: Just re-install the VM
  - **Word of advice:** It's best to stay away from playing 
    with root, bad things can happen

- Although, it is reccomended that you change the password
  - You can do so through settings or by opening the terminal
    and typing:
  ```console
  passwd
  ```

- You can also go through the settings and customise it to
  your preferences - remember, it is now your virtual computer

- You should regularly run the following two commands:
  - Update and upgrade packages
    ```console
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
    ```
    - `update` fetches the latest information of the installed packages
    - `upgrade` will upgrade them if newer versions have been released
    - the `-y` flag simply tells APT that it has permission to upgrade everything
      and doesn't have to ask you to say "yes" to each upgrade

  - Update [Snap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_(software)) packages
    ```console
    sudo snap refresh
    ```
  - Snap is Canonical's[^canon] deployment system
    - Ubuntu's equivalent of the App Store/Play Store/Windows Store

- You can close your VM by clicking on the close button, choosing 
  whether to keep the machine frozen in its current state or
  shut down completely; you can also use the power options in Ubuntu

## Configuring your VM
- This VM was created for the average computer one may have

- If you have a more powerful computer, you would benefit from increasing
  the resources your computer can dedicate to the VM

- To do so, press <kbd>Control</kbd>/<kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> or
  right-click and then choose **"Settings"** or click on the bright-orange 
  cog symbol in the ribbon
<img src="/images/vbox/config1.png" width="80%" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"/>

- You will see the settings screen
<img src="/images/vbox/config2.png" width="80%" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"/>

- Here, you can click through the various sections and configure your VM
  - **Word of Advice:** It is best to not mess with *most* of these

- You should look at the **"System"** and **"Display"** tabs and adjust the
  settings for your computer
  - It is recommended to give a quarter to a half of all your resources to a VM

- Play around with these settings and your VM will feel like a native install
  in no time

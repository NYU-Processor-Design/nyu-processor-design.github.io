# Your First Pull Request

---

## Purpose

The pull request is a mechanism for integrating changes between two copies of
the same repository. It is not an inherent process builtin to `git`, but rather
a formal or informal process built on top of `git`. In this section we'll
briefly exam the usage of the *GitHub* pull request system.

## Fork the Repo

A pull request is a request to incorporate changes made on one copy of a repo,
into another copy of the same repo. So to start we will need to make a copy
to perform changes on. In the case of the design notebooks, the repo to fork
is [the one that contains the site you're reading right now](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-processor-design.github.io).

To create a fork, you need only click the fork button at the top right of the page:

<img src="/images/git/fork.png" width="50%" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;" />

We can now clone the fork as usual.

## Branching

Before we start making changes, we probably want to _branch_ the repo. This way
we don't mess with the commit history of the "main" branch, so it will be
easy to incorporate changes that happen in the main repo we forked from.

To create a branch we can use the following command:

```
git branch -c branch_name
```

Then to switch to the branch we can use:

```
git switch branch_name
```

These two operations are so common, that there is a shortcut to do them in a
single command:

```
git switch -c branch_name
```

The same behavior can be found in Source Control by right clicking on a branch you
would like to branch from:

<img src="/images/git/branch.png" width="50%" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;" />

## Publishing Changes

After you have added your commits to the branch, you can publish the results to
Github with the following commands:

```
git push [remote_name] [branch_name]
```

This is equivalent to the Source Control "Publish Branch" button:

<img src="/images/git/publish.png" width="50%" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;" />

## Making a Pull Request

To make a pull request, navigate to the "Pull requests" tab of your repo:

<img src="/images/git/gh_pr01.png" width="50%" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;" />

And click "New pull request":

<img src="/images/git/gh_pr02.png" width="50%" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;" />

Use the drop-down menu on the right to select the correct branch you would like
to pull from:

<img src="/images/git/gh_pr03.png" width="50%" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;" />

Now create the pull request.

For the following dialogue, it's fine the leave the title as whatever is
generated for the commit. In the comments field, include any information
that might be pertinent but isn't included in the commit itself.

<img src="/images/git/gh_pr04.png" width="50%" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;" />

## Discarding the Branch

Once your PR has been merged into the "upstream" repository, it is safe to
delete the branch you did the work on.

You can do this with:

```
git switch main
git branch -D branch_name
git push origin -D branch_name
```

The first command switches off of the development branch, because you cannot
delete a branch that is currently checked-out. The second command deletes the
local copy of the branch, and the third command deletes the remote copy.

The deletions are equivalent to right clicking and selecting "Delete branch"
in Source Control.


## Integrating Upstream Changes

You can now pull the upstream changes into your repo, this can be done with

```
git pull [remote] [branch]
```

# Working Collaboratively

---
## Purpose

Collaboration is an essential part of working in any team. Much of our work is shared and built upon each others’ contributions - whether it is the components themselves, editing documentation, or making improvements to the **Processor Design Team** website. Additionally, as team members join the team with different areas of expertise, it is important to support one another in the learning and development process.

## Team Repositories

Team members should have access to the [NYU Processor Design Github organization](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design) and its repos. Throughout the project, you will need to add to or change the shared repos - for example, adding a design notebook entry to [this website](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-processor-design.github.io) or editing a component of the [AMBA] (https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-amba). To edit efficiently, fork the appropriate repo and make a temporary branch of your fork. After making changes, create a pull request to merge your changes to the team’s upstream repository by following [this guide](https://nyu-processor-design.github.io/getting_started/notebooks/04_first_pr.html). Creating a temporary branch ensures that you won’t be pushing extra/irrelevant changes to the team repo, such as syncing your fork from the upstream.

## Issues and Questions

Nobody’s perfect, which means there may be errors and questions on component modules, git documentation, et cetera. If you see a problem or have a question, ask the team and/or open a new issue on GitHub using [these guidelines](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/.github/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md). You can also use this contribution guide when submitting a design notebook entry.

## Additional Support

You are all talented and intelligent – that’s why you’re here – but team members will join the VIP with different levels of experience and knowledge. Part of working collaboratively is learning from one another and supporting each other. If you see someone struggling or learning something new, offer your assistance in a helpful and respectful way.

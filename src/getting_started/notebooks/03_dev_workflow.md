# Working With Your Repo

---

## Purpose

While some developers prefer to use `git` purely from the command line, others
enjoy using the interface built in to their IDE. This is purely a
preference-based decision. In this section, we'll demonstrate how do work
through some common `git` operations using both the command line, and how do to
the equivalent operation using the Source Control tab on VSCode and Anubis. Note that most of these features are provided by the *GitLens* plugin for VSCode and Anubis. 

There is far, far more to `git` than could be productively covered here. It is
highly recommended that you seek guidance from
[the Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) for a complete discussion of both
basic and advanced operations.

## Initializing a Repository

Inside a new empty folder, you can create a new `git` repo using the command:

```
git init
```

This is equivalent to using the "Initialize Repository" button in the Source Control
tab:

<img src="/images/git/init.webp" width="50%" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;" />

## Staging Files

When a new file is added to the project, or changes are made to a file, you can
inform `git` about those changes with the command:

```
git add [file_or_folder_names]
```

This command adds the files to "staging", which is what we call the set of file
changes that we're going permanently track in the repository.

A common pattern is to use:

```
git add .
```

Where the `.` is a Unix filesystem convention for refering to the current
folder. This command tells `git` to add all files that have been added or
changed to "staging".

The equivalent in the Source Control tab is to use the plus and minus signs to move
files in and out of "staging":

<img src="/images/git/staging.png" width="50%" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;" />

## Making a Commit

To make the collection of changes in staging permanent, we make a _commit_.
Every commit is accompanied by a message. You are encouraged, by not required,
to follow the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
guidelines for what to write in this message. The czar of a given repo may
require this or some other commit message format if you eventually want them to
incorporate your changes "upstream".

The commands to make a commit message depend on how long your message is,
commits with short messages can be made with the following:

```
git commit -m "docs(example): This is a commit message"
```

If a longer message is needed, the same command without the `-m` can be used:

```
git commit
```

`git` will open an editor to be filled with the commit message, when the file
is saved and the editor is exited, `git` will open that file and read the
commit message.

The equivalent in the Source Control tab is the commit box:

<img src="/images/git/commit.png" width="50%" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;" />

## Pushing Changes

Once changes have been made to a local repo, they can be pushed to tracked
remotes using the following command:

```
git push
```

This is _somewhat_ equivalent to the Source Control operation of "syncing"

<img src="/images/git/sync.png" width="50%" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;" />

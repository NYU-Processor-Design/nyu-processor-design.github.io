# Week 2: System Verilog

---

## Purpose

This is a crash course in basic System Verilog constructs. As some level of
exposure to Verilog is a requirement for access to the team, this lab consists
of a series of exercises that will ensure you've got the basics on lock.

If you find there is a construct or challenge you're unsure how to approach,
seek guidance from the team. Asking questions is encouraged.

## Setup

Fork [the Lab Week 2 repo](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/onboarding-lab-2)
to your personal Github account and complete the exercises in that repo. (For
design log purposes, this cloned repo will be the one you link to.)

The toolchain has already been setup for you for all the exercises. It uses
techniques you have not been introduced to yet so don't be concerned if you
don't understand all of it. You can build the simulations using the techniques
from the [Week 1 Onboarding Lab](02_cmake.md).

If you wish to test your work, you can do so by running the following command
inside your build directory:

```
ctest --output-on-failure .
```

We'll talk more about setting up and running tests in the next lab.

## Exercise 1: Warm Up

Implement the following opcode table with a single combinational `assign`
statement.

|    op    |      out
-----------|---------------
|     0    |     a + b
|     1    |     a - b
|     2    |     a & b
|     3    |     a \| b

## Exercise 2: Sequential Logic

Implement a xor-based Fibonacci Linear Feedback Shift Register with taps at bits
15, 13, 12, and 10. If the reset is low, the LFSR should be initialized with the
value present on the init input bus.

Step the output on positive clock edge.

## Exercise 3: Module Composition

There are two Mystery modules under the Mysteries directory. Compose them
according to the following schematic:

<img src="/images/mystery_diag.png" width="70%" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;" />

**Make Note:** In the next lab you'll learn more about verification testing, but
for now take a quick glance at `dv/exercise1.cpp`, `dv/exercise2.cpp`, and
`dv/exercise3.cpp`. Exercise1 _exhaustively_ tests all possible inputs,
Exercise2 _samples_ some possible initial values for a hundred cycles, and
Exercise3 _randomly_ tests inputs for a hundred cycles.

Why do you think the reason for these different testing approaches are? What
are their advantages and disadvantages?

## Exercise 4: Combinational Logic

Using an `always_comb` block, implement a decoder/mux that implements the
behavior described in the following table.

|    cs    |  sel  |   out
-----------|-------|-----------
|     0    |   X   |    0
|     1    |   0   |  alpha
|     1    |   1   |   beta
|     1    |   2   |  gamma
|     1    |   3   |    0

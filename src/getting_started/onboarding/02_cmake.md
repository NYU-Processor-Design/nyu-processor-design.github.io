# Week 1: CMake and Toolchain

---

## Before You Begin

Take some time to review the [Lab Guidance](01_guidance.md) before beginning on
these labs. If you're using the labs to populate your design notebook entries,
failure to follow the lab guidance could adversely affect your
***Documentation***  grade.

## Purpose

In both hardware and software development, we use a variety of tools to achieve
our goals, tools such as compilers, linkers, simulators, etc. These tools can
be quite complex, have non-trivial inter-dependencies, and the overall process
of invoking all the necessary tools to build the final product may have many
steps.

For projects of sufficient complexity, it is rarely feasible and never desirable
to run all the necessary tools by hand. Instead, we write programs to run the
tools for us. These programs are collectively referred to as the
***toolchain***. In this lab, you will learn to work with the major toolchain
program used by the **Processor Design Team**, a tool called `cmake`.[^why]

## Part 1: CMake Hello World

`cmake` is a tool for describing toolchains. Typical usage of `cmake` looks
like:

```cmake
cmake [directory]
```

Where `[directory]` is a location on the filesystem that contains a file named
`CMakeLists.txt`. This file is often referred to as an acronym, "CML", and we will do so in these lab instructions as well.

We will start by creating an empty `CMakeLists.txt` file in the lab directory.
Before we put any commands into the file, we need to know what version of
`cmake` we are running. We can discover this with the command:

```
cmake --version
```

**Make Note:** What version of `cmake` is running in your environment?

The `cmake` version number is split into three parts, separated by periods. The
first is called the _major_ version, the second the _minor_ version, and the
third is called the _patch_ number. These make up a system known as
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) which we will discuss more in a later
lab.

Now we are ready to add the first line of code to our CML file, and it should
look like this:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION [major].[minor])
```

In this line of code, `[major]` and `[minor]` should be the major and minor
version number you learned from the earlier command. As you might suspect,
`cmake_minimum_required` is a cmake command which will ensure the `cmake` tool
running the file is _at least_ of a minimum version. Unless you're specifically
testing or making certain your CML runs on older `cmake` versions, it's best to
set this to the version of `cmake` you're currently using.

The next line of code isn't strictly necessary for `"Hello World"`, but you will
see it in nearly every CML so we'll include it here too:

```cmake
project(week-one-lab VERSION 1.0.0)
```

Here we have the project name and version number for our code. This isn't very
significant yet, but it will be in the future.

It's time to make the magic happen, the third line of your CML will be:

```cmake
message("Hello World")
```

Now we're ready to run `cmake`. First, create a directory named `build` inside
your lab folder. In a console, navigate to the `build` directory and run the
command `cmake ..`. The `..` tells `cmake` to look for our CML file in the
parent folder of our current working directory.

`cmake` will generate an amount of output, but among its many messages should be
our `"Hello World"`!


## Part 2: Building a Program

The astute student will notice that our `build` directory is now filled with
random crap. This is, in fact, why we created the `build` directory. In the
future, we're always going to want to run `cmake` in its own directory for
this reason, so that the generated files don't pollute our source code folder.

But what are all these files? What purpose do they serve? Before we answer
that question, let's try to build an actual program with `cmake`. First,
write a Hello World program in C++ and save it as `hello.cpp` at the top
level of the lab repository (the same folder which holds the CML).

Next, we're going to tell `cmake` we would like to build a program, using the
following two lines of code. You can remove your `message()` command from the
CML and replace it with:

```cmake
add_executable(hello_world)
target_sources(hello_world PRIVATE hello.cpp)
```

The first line informs `cmake` about the new program named `hello_world` that
we would like to create, and the second tells `cmake` about a source code file
we would like to associate with this new program, and that's it! (We're going
to ignore that `PRIVATE` keyword for now).

Inside the build directory, run the `cmake ..` command again to re-run the
`cmake` tool on the edited CML.

Unfortunately, our program has not been created. In fact, the files inside the
build directory are exactly the same files as before. Before we answer _that_
question, let's get a working hello world program. The following command, run
inside the build directory, will build the final program:

```cmake
make
```

**The command is `make` _not_ `cmake`**

**Make Note:** Run `make help` and figure out what the valid targets (command
  arguments) are for this project. For all the targets that start with "hello",
  can you figure out what they produce? What about `all` and `clean`?

Despite their similar names, `make` and `cmake` are completely unrelated
programs. `make` is a build system, it produces a final program executable that
you can run. `cmake` is a _meta_-build system, it reads the CML and _produces
other build systems_, such as the `Makefile` that `make` uses to build our
`hello_world` program.

Just like a compiler can support multiple computer architectures, `cmake`
supports multiple build systems. In the build directory, try running the
following commands so that `cmake` will generate a `ninja` build system instead
of a `make` build system (the first command removes the old files from the
build directory, to prevent errors):

```cmake
rm -rf *
cmake -G Ninja ..
```

Now you can run the `ninja` command in the build directory to produce the final
binary. Optionally, you can run `cmake --build .` and `cmake` will run the
correct build tool for whichever build system was generated.

Why is this so complicated? Historically, build systems were either fast and
hard to use or very slow but flexible and easy to use. `cmake`'s solution to
this problem was a flexible tool that generates a fast build system. The `ninja`
build system in particular is never meant to be used directly by humans, but
only as a target for other programs like `cmake`.

## Part 3: Adding More Files

Now that we have basic `cmake` usage down, there's only a little more left to
talk about before you're ready to strike out on your own.

Let's create a more typical file structure, we're going to have an `src`
directory that holds C++ implementation files, and an `include` directory
that holds C++ header files. We're also going to create two new files,
`name.cpp` and `name.hpp`. The final file structure should look like this:

<img src="/images/folders.webp" width="40%" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;" />

In `name.cpp` write a function that asks the user their name, and returns it as
a `std::string` and add the function declaration to `name.hpp`. In `hello.cpp`,
include the header file with `#include "name.hpp"` and call the associated
function so that you can greet the user by name.

We can modify our `target_sources` command in the CML to account for the new
file locations:

```cmake
target_sources(hello_world PRIVATE src/hello.cpp src/name.cpp)
```

It would also be acceptable to do this across multiple commands:

```cmake
target_sources(hello_world PRIVATE src/hello.cpp)
target_sources(hello_world PRIVATE src/name.cpp)
```

Header files do not need to be added directly, instead, we just need to inform
the build system what directories to search for them in:

```cmake
target_include_directories(hello_world PRIVATE include)
```

You should now be able to build and run your modified hello world program

**Answer the following:**
* The paths used by `target_sources` and `target_include_directories` are
  _relative_, not absolute. What file or folder are they _relative to_?

* What are some differences between `cmake` and `ninja`?

* Why is it important to run `cmake` in its own directory?

[^why]: You may wonder, "Why do I have to learn this before I've written any
code?" In programming classes where you only had to run a compiler on a single
file, it was fine to just invoke the compiler directly. For hardware design,
even the simplest designs will involve running dozens of commands. It would
slow you down significantly if you didn't know how to use the toolchain before
moving into the actual design process.

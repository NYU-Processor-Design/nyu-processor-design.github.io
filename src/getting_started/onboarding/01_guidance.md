# Lab Guidance

---

## Purpose

What follows is generic guidance applicable to all of the Onboarding Labs

## Guidance

* Labs do not require any specific computing environment so long as the
  required tools are present. You are free (and somewhat encouraged) to work on
  a personal machine. However, all of the requirements for the labs are provided
  on Anubis if you don't have a development machine that can run the required
  tooling.

* For a personal computing environment, the required tools across all the labs
  are the following:

  * cmake

  * verilator

  * git

  * curl

  * zip, unzip

  * tar

* Labs are intended to be run and completed in their own directory/repository.
  If a lab requires you to clone an existing repository and work inside it,
  that will be noted in the instructions.

* For the purposes of the design notebook, you will need to push the final state
  of a given lab directory to a repo. You can then link to this repo in your
  design notebook, see [the Design Notebook Guide](../notebooks/04_first_design.md)
  for more.

* Labs may ask that you **Make Note** or **Answer the following** at various
  points in their instructions. These notes and answers should be collected in
  a `ReadMe.md` file in the root of the lab directory. There is no specific
  layout required for this file, other than it should be obvious what notes
  and questions correspond to which answers.

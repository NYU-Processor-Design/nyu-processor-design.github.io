# Week 3: Verification

---

## Purpose

The layout of this lab is the same as the previous one, but the situation
is reversed. Instead of having all the tests available and implemented already
and filling in the SystemVerilog, the SystemVerilog is written and you will be
implementing tests.

Testing, in the hardware world we call it "design verification", is essential
to ensuring that designs fulfill their intent. The options for repairing hardware
that has already been fabricated are limited.

## Background

In the **Processor Design Team**, design verification tests are regular C++
programs. If the program returns `0` from its `main` function, the test has
passed, if the program returns something non-zero, the test has failed.

The heart of a test is the model. The model is a simulation of the
device-under-test (DUT), synthesized from the SystemVerilog files which describe
it using a program known as `verilator`. You don't need to worry about invoking
or using `verilator` directly, the toolchain does that for you.

The model is a C++ object, the public members of this object are the port list
present on the SystemVerilog module. For example a module with the following
port list:

```verilog
module DUT(
    input [7:0] alpha;
    input [7:0] beta;

    output [15:0] gamma;
);
```

Will generate a model with the following public members:
```cpp
struct VDUT {
  uint8_t alpha;
  uint8_t beta;

  uint16_t gamma;
};
```

When changing inputs, the outputs of the model can be evaluated using the
`.eval()` method. For example:

```cpp
  VDUT model;
  model.alpha = 5;
  model.beta = 8;
  model.eval();

  // model.gamma will change
```

## Setup

Fork the [Lab Week 3 repo](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/onboarding-lab-3)
to your personal Github account and complete the exercises in that repo. (For
design log purposes, this cloned repo will be the one you link to.)

The toolchain has already been set up for you for all the exercises. It uses
techniques you have not been introduced to yet so don't be concerned if you
don't understand all of it. You can build the simulations using the techniques
from the [Week 1 Onboarding Lab](02_cmake.md).

## Exercise 1: Something Familiar

Write a test that verifies the module implements the following behavior. Test
all possible values of `a` and `b` for each operation.

|    op    |      out
-----------|---------------
|     0    |     a ^ b
|     1    |     a << b
|     2    |     a % b
|     3    |     ~(a & b)

## Exercise 2: Reading Rainbow

Being able to read code is as important as being able to write it. For this
exercise, assume that the module is correct. This test is being written to
ensure that any future changes to the module do not change its external
behavior.

Design a test that reasonably verifies the behavior of the Exercise2 module.
Note that testing the entire space of possible states is likely not viable.

**Make Note:** What testing strategy did you adopt for this Exercise2? What
decisions did you have to make and how did you come up with your answers?

## Exercise 3: A Verification in Many Parts

The Exercise3 module follows the same schematic as in Lab 2:

<img src="/images/mystery_diag.png" width="70%" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;" />

However, the mysteries have been changed. Mystery1 operates as follows:
* If `a` is 0, then `d` is:

| Bits  |  7:6 |  5:3   |  2:0
|-------|------|--------|-------
| Value | b'00 | b[2:0] | c[2:0]

* If `a` is 1, then `d` is:

| Bits  |  7:6 |  5:3   |  2:0
|-------|------|--------|-------
| Value | b'01 | c[2:0] | b[2:0]

* If `a` is 2, then `d` is `b`

* If `a` is 3, then `d` is `c`


And Mystery2 operates according to the following rules:

* Clocked on negative clock edge

* When `reset` is high, out is initialized to:

| Bits  |  15:8 |  7:0
|-------|-------|--------
| Value |  b_in |  a_in

* When `reset` is low, the output cycles through the following states:

| State | Value
| ----- | -----
|   0   |  {a_in, out[7:0]}
|   1   |  {out[15:8], b_in}
|   2   |  {out[7:0], out[15:8]}
|   3   |  {out[3:0], out[7:4], out[11:8], out[15:12]}
|   4   |  {15'b0, ^out}

Write a test that reasonably verifies the behavior of the module.

## Exercise 4:

The Exercise4 module has the following behavior:

|    cs    |  sel  |   out
-----------|-------|-----------
|     0    |   X   |    0
|     1    |   0   |  alpha
|     1    |   1   |   beta
|     1    |   2   |  gamma
|     1    |   3   |  alpha & (beta \| gamma)

Write a test that reasonably verifies the behavior of the module.

**Make Note**: How does testing a Don't Care work? What must be done to ensure
the input truly has no effect on output?

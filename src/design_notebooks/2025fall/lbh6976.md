# Louai's Design Notebook

## Week of 22 September 2025 (Week 4)

### Week 1 Catchup
Project Work:
* Completed "Design Notebooks and Git" and "Development Environment"

Had no issues following the instructions. Maybe a note should be added on the WSL section to make sure to update your version of Ubuntu to the latest version
before attempting to add the new repos since that caused me a lot of headache.

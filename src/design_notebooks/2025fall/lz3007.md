## Week 1: 09/08/2025 - 09/14/2025

* worked through "Design Notebooks and Git" and "Development Environment" on the VIP website
* completed "Getting Started" and "Verilog Language: Basics" on HDLBits

I downloaded WSL and Ubuntu (and packages) using the Windows Powershell terminal. There were no problems in this process.

I am using VS Code for the first time, so I had a hard time navagating the files and learning how to use VS Code with Ubuntu. I hard a hard time creating a branch in my fork repository and could not tell where I was in the repository (main or branch) until I searched up the documentation for [Git source control in VS Code] (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview).

The HDLBits problem sets were a great refresher for me and it does explain in more detail on how Verilog works compared to a circuit.

I am still kind of confused with how Ubuntu works with VS Code and where the files are stored (locally?).

# Noah Mays-Smith's Design Notebook

## Week One:
This week I created 2025fall design notebook folder, created and presented the slideshow for our first meeting, 
and split the new members into their pairs for the RiSC-16 project. Next week, I plan on meeting with each of the teams,
either all together or individually, to ensure they are set on the right track for the project. Additionally, I will create 
a page on the website dedicated to the RiSC-16 project, so that everyone can access information easily.

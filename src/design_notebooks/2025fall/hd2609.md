Summary: Now all labs are finished. For next week, I will find meeting time with team for next step.

## Week of October 12th

### Project Work

* Did more Verilog practice questions on the HDLBits. I finished until "Connecting to poarts by position" problem.
  
Summary: This week I did not meet with team because I was busy with midterms and presentations. I did not have time to meet with team. I have one more midterm next week on Wednesday. I plan to meet with team on Friday or on weekend. 

## Week of October 19th

### Project Work

* Did more Verilog practice questions on the HDLBits. I finished until "Adder 1" problem.
* Finished reading lab 5, even if it is incomplete. 
  
Summary: I have one midterm and a presentation to prepare this week, so not a lot progress. Howver, this week I met with team and discussed the next step. I should work on the rest of the labs. Then I will assist other memebers in the future.

## Week of October 26th

### Project Work

* Did more Verilog practice questions on the HDLBits. I finished until "Adder-substractor" problem.
* Started testing some code of Lab 5 in VScode, but met some bugs. It seems due to the version of Verilog. Some code are not supported by the current version installed in my VScode.
  
Summary: This week I met with team on Wednesday, which is the weekly meeting in this semester. The team will work on Lab 1 and Lab 2 next week. I will prepare to assist on them. Also, due to the bug I met, I plan to debug it next week. 

## Week of November 2nd

### Project Work

* Did more Verilog practice questions on the HDLBits. I finished until "If statement" problem.
* Figured out bugs I met on VScode. It is the problem with the command I typed in terminal. I need to add -g2012 to allow iVerilog know that it compiles with 2012 version of verilog. The new types, such as "logic" or "byte" cannot be recognized by the version of 2005. If I do not add -g2012 in the command, it compiles with version of 2005, which gives me a lot of errors in both testbench and design files.
* I tested more codes until module TopLevel(). Mainly understand it because there is no exercise for it.

Summary: This week I spent most of the time on debugging the VScode. I plan to understand the rest of the code in lab 5 next week.

## Week of November 2nd

### Project Work

* Did more Verilog practice questions on the HDLBits. I finished until "Case statement" problem.
* I tested more codes until title "Parameterized Modules & Interfaces". I feel I am still confused by interface and modport. I understand the concepts in Verilog. interfaces group related signals together and modports define directional views of those signals. I am still confused by how they worked together in Verilog. I think need some simple examples on illustrating them.

Summary: This week I spent most of the time testing the code and understanding concepts in lab 5. I will finish lab 5 next week. Also, I plan to finish lab 7 next week since I see lab 7 is mainly readings, not coding.

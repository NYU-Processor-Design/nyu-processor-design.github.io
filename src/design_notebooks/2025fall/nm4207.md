# Noah Mays-Smith's Design Notebook

## Week One:
This week I created 2025 fall design notebook folder, created and presented the slideshow for our first meeting, 
and split the new members into their pairs for the RiSC-16 project. Next week, I plan on meeting with each of the teams,
either all together or individually, to ensure they are set on the right track for the project. Additionally, I will create 
a page on the website dedicated to the RiSC-16 project, so that everyone can access information easily. 

## Week Two:
### This week I
- Started reaching out to groups to try to meet with them directly and assess their progress
- Created and sent out week 2 onboarding project slideshow. Working on week 3
- Wrote my own pc file, and a testbench to go with it

### Comments
- I met with the group leadership about splitting up the larger group project. I would rather be told what section to work on, rather than figure it out for myself, because I'm preoccupied by a lot of the onboarding work
- I briefly discussed adding a new position for mini/medium project leader so that we can participate in hackathons, fun/showboating projects, or other related things
- Thinking about having a whole team meeting next Monday to make sure everyone's up to speed.
- Going to send out week 3 onboarding slideshow ASAP. It's going to be about the ALU, and pointing people in the direction of my testbench, so that they can try to write one for the ALU.

# Noah Mays-Smith's Design Notebook

## Week One:
This week I created 2025 fall design notebook folder, created and presented the slideshow for our first meeting, 
and split the new members into their pairs for the RiSC-16 project. Next week, I plan on meeting with each of the teams,
either all together or individually, to ensure they are set on the right track for the project. Additionally, I will create 
a page on the website dedicated to the RiSC-16 project, so that everyone can access information easily. 

## Week Two:
### This week I:
- Started reaching out to groups to try to meet with them directly and assess their progress
- Created and sent out week 2 onboarding project slideshow. Working on week 3
- Wrote my own pc file, and a testbench to go with it

### Comments:
- I met with the group leadership about splitting up the larger group project. I would rather be told what section to work on, rather than figure it out for myself, because I'm preoccupied by a lot of the onboarding work
- I briefly discussed adding a new position for mini/medium project leader so that we can participate in hackathons, fun/showboating projects, or other related things
- Thinking about having a whole team meeting next Monday to make sure everyone's up to speed.
- Going to send out week 3 onboarding slideshow ASAP. It's going to be about the ALU, and pointing people in the direction of my testbench, so that they can try to write one for the ALU.

## Week 3:
### This week I:
Did presentation and made alu.v and alu_tb.v
### Comments:
none

## Week 4:
### This week I:
- Completed the testbench and module for the register file
- Completed Github presentation with Darren
- Kept tabs on some groups falling behind to catch them up to speed
### Comments:
- I was quite busy this week, and had trouble completing the testbench for the register file. I'm a little concerned that it isn't 100% accurate, or that it isn't in line with the exact specifications in the RiSC-16 Info Sheets
- I decided not too assign any new work this week, and instead have people catch up, and show me their designs functioning with my testbench. I want to discuss their thought process while designing their modules, and also describe how I go about making the testbench.
- There was no slideshow this week because there was no new module to make.
- I don't yet know what to choose for the next module, but I will figure that out in the next few days.
- For the next module, I am considering writing the module and then having the groups write a testbench for it to make sure that it functions properly.


## Week 5:
### This week I:
- Met with several groups to get them up to date
- Fixed the register file so that it no longer took the full instruction
- Created slideshow and assigned Data Memory file
- Wrote module and testbench for Data Memory

### Comments:
- Finished a little early in the week, but forgot to submit DN


## Week 6:
### This week I:
- Met with one more group to make sure they were finishing their work
- Made the slideshow for the Instruction Memory and Control Files

### Comments:
- Did not have a lot of time to work on the project this week
- Still need to have a meeting with Vito to figure out the direction of the VIP
- Decided to combine the last 2 modules both because they're fairly straightforward, and for the sake of finishing faster
- Need to talk with Darren to figure out the transition to the larger project

## Week 7:
### This week I:
- Finished my design of the Instruction Memory and Control Module
- Finished My Control Module Testbench
- Talked with several groups to get them up to speed

## Week 8:
### This week I:
- Attended Wednesday's meeting
- Didn't do a lot of work due to midterms

## Week 9:
### This week I:
- Assigned Onboarding Labs 1 and 2 for people to complete to get them ready for running their own programs on the RiSC-16

## Week 10:
### This week I:
- Ran the Wednesday meeting to make sure all groups are up to date on their work
- Assisted some groups with the problems they were having

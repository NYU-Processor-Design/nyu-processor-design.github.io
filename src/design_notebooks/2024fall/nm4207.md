# Noah Mays-Smith's Design Notebook

Week One:
Created first design notebook

Week 1.5:
Finished Lab 1: https://github.com/Noahms12/lab1

Had some problems with updating my notebook. I need to get the hang of the order that everything is done in. 
Suggestion for "Your first design notebook". The description "(link/to/repo)" is not clear on whether it wants a link to a file within our repo or a link to my personal github. I'd recommend changing it to something like "https://github.com/example"

Week 2:
Started work on Lab 2: https://github.com/Noahms12/onboarding-lab-2.git

Attended the meeting on Thursday and asked some questions about parts of lab 1 that I was confused about as well as asked for help figuring out the workflow for each lab.
Worked through excercise 1 after reteaching myself some verilog. Then I compared my solution to people in previous semesters to ensure it was correct. I cannot figure out where to run the command "ctest --output-on-failure ." to test my code for Excercise 1. I ran it in all of the files in the lab directory, but every time I got the output "No tests were found!!!"

# Noah Mays-Smith's Design Notebook

Week One:
Created first design notebook

Week Two:
Finished Lab 1: https://github.com/Noahms12/lab1

Had some problems with updating my notebook. I need to get the hang of the order that everything is done in. 
Suggestion for "Your first design notebook". The description "(link/to/repo)" is not clear on whether it wants a link to a file within our repo or a link to my personal github. I'd recommend changing it to something like "https://github.com/example"

# Uma Nachiappan's Design Notebook

A Doc Czar doc czarring and processor designing...

## Week of 23 Sept 2024
- figuring out how to admin!
- team meetings scheduled and started
- trying to get all the design notebooks on the site and have new members working on onboarding, with old members continuing their previous work
- continuing to re-draft site docs

## Week of 30 Sept 2024
- had some issues with a few labs & CMake (various development environment differences, cmake version differences)
- signed up for VIP Showcase and got volunteers for the table
- got an email for Rising Violets (fundraising opportunity)

## Week of 7 Oct 2024
- attendance/dn issues
- spoke to people about transitioning to core/AMBA development
- had a mini crisis about not paying enough attention to PRs and DNs

## Week of 14 Oct 2024
- VIP showcase! Our three QR codes against the world (and the robot next to us). Had some recruitment! and students who already applied also showed up.
- Started actually assessing where people were with DN progress --> thinking about midterm grading/reports

## Week of 21 Oct 2024
- midterm reports! and getting people to actually push their notebooks -- looking a little sparse as I write this (including my own). I don't want the C train but who knows, that might be where this is going.
- procrastinating on site docs as usual
- need to check in with core team leads to see what's going on -- no serious commits since last semester

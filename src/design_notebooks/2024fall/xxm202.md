        Q.

        Q. The paths used by target_sources and target_include_directories are relative, not absolute. What file or folder are they relative to?
        A. The paths are relative to the CMakeLists.txt file that contains the target_sources and target_include_directories commands.

        Q. What are some differences between cmake and ninja?
        A. CMake is a build system generator that generates build files for a build system like Ninja. Ninja is a build system that reads in build files and executes the build. CMake can generate build files for other build systems like Make, but Ninja is the recommended build system for this course.

        Q. Why is it important to run cmake in its own directory?
        A. Running cmake in its own directory allows you to keep the build files separate from the source files. This makes it easier to clean up the build files and start fresh if needed.

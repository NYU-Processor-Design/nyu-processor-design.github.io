# Xhovani's VIP Processor Design Notebook - Fall 2024

## Weekly Updates

### Week of 23 September 2024

**Progress Summary:**

I set up my development environment on my MacBook Pro. Homebrew is already
installed from prior internship work. For virtualization, I use Parallels on
macOS and access VirtualBox remotely on my desktop.

**Project Work:**

* **Onboarding Lab 1**
   - **Repository Link:** [Onboarding Lab 1 Repository](https://github.com/XhovaniM8/nyu-processor-onboarding-labs/blob/ec05b7ff31fda2f9afc7407b5a553b8e223571fb/onboarding-lab-1/cmake-test/ReadMe.md)
   - **Issue Encountered:** I encountered issues with CMake, specifically an
   error during the build process suggesting compatibility issues.
   - **Resolution:** Resolved the issue by reinstalling `make` with support for
   the arm64 architecture.

   - **Issue Encountered:** Testing command wouldn't recognize the folder structure from the build folder.

## Anu's Design Notebook

### Week of Sept 16, 2024
* Started labs and created my design notebook

### Week of Sept 23, 2024
* Finished lab 1 this week, got started on lab 2
* Lab 1 was pretty fun but also the link didn't work initially, seems to be an update error.
* link to be updated shortly

### Week of Sept 30, 2024
* Finished lab 2, did not get started on lab 3
* Lab 2 was also pretty basic since i have a lot of experience with verilog, so no troubles here
* Started going through the projects in the github to find what I want to do

### Week of Oct 7, 2024
* I did Lab 3, it took me longer than expected because of a bug that had no right being as hard to fix as it was
* I'm pretty interested in Memory and/or Amba, so ima read up so more. Optimization problems are fun and this is a pretty complex one.
* The teams are pretty bare though, so I'm digging through the previous documentation
 
### Week of Oct 14, 2024
* started lab 4, did not finish
* Midterms are next week so not very productive when it comes to the VIP right now. Did some research on how exactly memory works.

### Week of Oct 21, 2024
* May god have mercy on our souls

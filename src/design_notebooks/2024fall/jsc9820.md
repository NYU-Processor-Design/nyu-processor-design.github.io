### **Week 1**:
- Reviewed all of the labs

### **Week 2**:
- Looked into AMBA and Core teams. Talked to some people about them. AMBA seemed interesting at first because I wanted to learn more about communication protocols.
- Deciding to just go with the Core team

### **Week 3**:
- Before breaking into the RISC-V processor design, I am currently creating a very simple CPU which I am going to implement on an FPGA
- Thinking about having a 2 bit instruction set for addition, subtraction, and, or
- 4 bit registers
- Thinking about what parts of a Control Unit I would need to make the CPU barely functional
- Currently designing memory unit

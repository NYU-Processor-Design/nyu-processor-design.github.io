# Ben Feng 2024 Design notebook
--------------------------------------
## week 3 of 19 September 2024

Project work: 
  * [onboarding lab 1](https://github.com/BenFeng666/Lab-1): complete lab . 

I finished lab 1 this week and learned how to build new system with Cmake and also learned how to work in the virtual box for the first time. 

The work enviorment was pretty struggling and especially how to getting used to with the Ubunto in the virtual box. Also, I done the pull request wrong and thankfully Vito help me out at the end.

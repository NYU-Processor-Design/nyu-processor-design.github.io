# Ben Bayor's Markdown file
** Week of 11 December 2023**
  * [Onboarding Lab 4](https://github.com/benclockworks/onboarding-lab-4.git):
    Completed Lab 4, I have a worklog.txt to show my efforts and since the links for onboarding Lab 5 aren't working at the Moment I will ask vito what to do about that
    I did join one of Michael Luppe's Core Design meetings and I would like to join that team and will ask for his approval
** Week of 2 October 2023**

Project Work:
  * [Onboarding Lab 1](https://github.com/benclockworks/onboarding-lab-1.git): Completed Lab 1, communicated to Vito about pushing and when it is appropriate to push or not and the quality of files
 
  * [Onboarding Lab 2](https://github.com/benclockworks/onboarding-lab-2.git): Completed Lab 2, Communicated to Riyshak and he confirmed that it should be obvious if I completed it or not 

  * [Onboarding Lab 3](https://github.com/benclockworks/onboarding-lab-3.git): Completed Lab 3, I had to test it through my terminal instead of the ingtegrated terminal but, the waveform looked right to me  I am sorry i asked for the pull request so late I was making sure I understood what was happeneing and I was having an issue with vcpkg for a bit and i still need to figure out the git issue in my integrated terminal to VSCode
 

  * [Doc Workflow Update](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-processor-design.github.io/pull/183): Updated the branch with my work for the Lab I wasn't too sure where to put it  but, I hope my placement of it is appropriate


This week was mostly me catching up with the onboarding labs. I communicated my availability with Riyshak and I wasn't able to go to the meeting.

I am still struggling using the VSCode editor for github purpose.

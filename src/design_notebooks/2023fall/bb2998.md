# Ben Bayor's Markdown file

Project Work:
  * [Onboarding Lab 1](https://github.com/benclockworks/onboarding-lab-1.git): Completed Lab 1, communicated to Vito about pushing and when it is appropriate to push or not and the quality of files
 
  * [Onboarding Lab 2](https://github.com/benclockworks/onboarding-lab-2.git): Completed Lab 2, Communicated to Riyshak and he confirmed that it should be obvious if I completed it or not 

  * [Onboarding Lab 3](link/to/repo): Completed Lab 3, I had to test it through my terminal instead of the ingtegrated terminal but, the waveform looked right to me 
  * [Onboarding Lab 4](link/to/repo): Completed Lab 3, I had to test it through my terminal instead of the ingtegrated terminal but, the waveform looked right to me 
  * [Onboarding Lab 5](link/to/repo): Completed Lab 3, I had to test it through my terminal instead of the ingtegrated terminal but, the waveform looked right to me 

  * [Doc Workflow Update](link/to/pull_request): Updated the branch with my work for the Lab I wasn't too sure where to put it  but, I hope my placement of it is appropriate


This week was mostly me catching up with the onboarding labs. I communicated my availability with Riyshak and I wasn't able to go to the meeting.

I am still struggling using the VSCode editor for github purpose.

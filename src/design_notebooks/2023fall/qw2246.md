Last few weeks were all over the place. This week tried finish lab 2 and had some issue with testing exercise 4, but magically fixed it by re-running ninja build.

## Week of 1 October 2023

* [Onboarding Lab 3](https://github.com/hahacharlie/3-lab-onboarding): Completed Lab 3

This week finished lab 3. Encountered some problem with Exercise 3 due to bitwise shifting, with helps from the discord chanel, I was able to debug it. Thanks to Rishyak. It appears that gdb debugger is not supported for my mac workstation, need to switch to lldb for debugging.

Last few weeks were all over the place. This week tried finish lab 2 and had some issue with testing exercise 4, but magically fixed it by re-running ninja build.

## Week of 1 October 2023

* [Onboarding Lab 3](https://github.com/hahacharlie/3-lab-onboarding): Completed Lab 3

Had some problem with exercise 3, due to the bitwise shifting, and could not use the gdb debugger since my mac only has lldb. However, with the help from Rishyak, I was able to figure out the problem and finish the lab.

# Aneesh's Design Notebook

## September 18th, 2023:

Project Work:
- Set up [GitHub fork](https://github.com/aminoa/nyu-processor-design.github.io) to work on projects and submit pull requests
- Did Lab 1 [here](https://github.com/aminoa/proc-design/tree/main/labs/lab1)

I got my GitHub repo set up and worked on setting up my development environment. I also got through the first lab. I plan on getting through the rest of them throughout this week.

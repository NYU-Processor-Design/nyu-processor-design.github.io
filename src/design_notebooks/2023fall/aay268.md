# Week of September 11, 2023
Project Work:
  * Read up on GitHub functionality (mainly Repos, Branches, Forks, and Pull Requests)
  * Created first design notebook entry

Admittedly I won't have much time this semester, so my goal is to at least complete the onboarding labs. I aim to start (and ideally complete) Onboarding Lab 1 by the end of next week.

# Week of September 18, 2023
Project Work:
  * Refreshed self on Markdown -> practiced using it in Discord
  * Reviewed Verilog Syntax

I didn't properly plan out my tasks for this week, so I haven't actually started Onboarding Lab 1. I did get a chance to review Verilog and Verilog syntax while preparing for a CompArch Recitation. I reviewed the conditional and bitwise operators, as well as refreshed myself on simultaneous vs. sequential assignment. I also got scolded by Vito for telling the students some misinformation about the existence of the `xor` gate... my bad.

# Week of September 25, 2023
Project Work:
  * Started Onboarding Lab 1 in Anubis (don't know how to link it yet)
  * I made my first CML file using Anubis, and got "Hello World" to print in the terminal. 

I created a folder for my onboarding labs in my personal copy before realizing that wasn't what I was supposed to do. Got slightly overwhelmed trying to figure out how to delete it - I feel like a toddler. Currently trying to find a good YT series to walk me through the baby steps of GitHub. Also still don't how to directly link my work in Anubis to the Github repository, will ask Vito about it this Tuesday.\

For this upcoming week, I want to finish Onboarding Lab 1. This week, I didn't make the stupid mistake of grading multiple homework problems so hopefully I'll have time.

# Week of October 2, 2023
Project Work:
  * Finished [Onboarding Lab 1](https://github.com/Auryny268/onboarding_lab1)

I finally finished Onboarding Lab 1! I had to go to Rishyak and Vito's office hours to wrap my head around GitHub, git, the whole shebang. I also downloaded VSCode which has improved my life significantly. Unfortunately I don't think I'll be able to start the next lab for a while since I'll be super busy with dogsitting, midterms, and homework for Scientific Computing (T ^ T) . I'm hoping to get enough free time to finish Onboarding Lab 2 after my PDEs midterm on Oct 19th.

# Week of October 9, 2023
Project Work:
  * N/A

I accidentally deleted this entry because I realized I hadn't gone through all the steps to merge it with upstream, oopsies. Anyways I was too busy with dogsitting so I didn't get any work done this week. Next week I'll have a ton of midterms, so I don't anticipate being able to complete much. 

(Side note: while I was napping the dog I watching pulled my coat off a chair into his crate and was chewing on it. He completely wrecked my headphone dongle, but I couldn't help but think it was a little cute.)

# Week of November 13, 2023
Project Work:
  * N/A

Had a Stats midterm and needed to grade projects, so I wasn't able to get any work done this week. Will try to attempt onboarding lab 2 over Thanksgiving.


# Week of November 20, 2023
  * Reviewed methods to maintain Cache Coherancy (mainly bus snooping)
  * Researched all lingo used in "Thrashing the snoopy bus"
  * Read about [False Sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_sharing)

I saw that the Core team was working on Caches and thought about a silly phrase Vito said in a previous recitation. I had heard of thrashing in the context of virtual memory back in CompArch (i.e. computer performance degrading due to frequent page swaps between physical memory and disk, which is meant to handle physical memory being overcommitted). I didn't realize it could also apply to coherent (multiprocessor) caching as well.

After reading the wikipedia article on 'False Sharing', I thought would have been cool to take Distributive Systems with Jepst as my last CS elective,,, alas t'wasn't meant to be.

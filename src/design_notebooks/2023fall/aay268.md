# Week of September 11, 2023
Project Work:
  * Read up on GitHub functionality (mainly Repos, Branches, Forks, and Pull Requests)
  * Created first design notebook entry

Admittedly I won't have much time this semester, so my goal is to at least complete the onboarding labs.\
I aim to start (and ideally complete) Onboarding Lab 1 by the end of next week.

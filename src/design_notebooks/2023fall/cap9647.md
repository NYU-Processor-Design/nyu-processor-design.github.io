Hello, my name is Carlos and this is my first design notebook.

I am a transfer sophomore pursuing a computer engineering major. Thank you for bringing me onboard this VIP group.

I spent this week working on the onboarding lab 1 which help me familiarize myself with the concept of the toolchain and its purposes as well as the structure of CMake and build systems.

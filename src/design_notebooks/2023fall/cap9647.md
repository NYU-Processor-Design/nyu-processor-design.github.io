# Carlos's Design Notebook
Hello, my name is Carlos and this is my first design notebook.

I am a transfer sophomore pursuing a computer engineering major. Thank you for bringing me onboard this VIP group.

## Week 1 (Sept. 11 - Sept.17)

Tasks: 
* [Onboarding Lab 1](https://github.com/cperezguzman/On_boarding_lab_1.git): Completed Lab 1
	

I spent this week working on the onboarding lab 1 which help me familiarize myself with the concept of the toolchain and its purposes as well as the structure of CMake and build systems. 

As someone who has had minimal interaction with git and GitHub, I need to get accustomed to and improve my understanding of git and GitHub, so Thursday night I spent getting help from Rishyak and making my design notebook, as well as practicing how to make repos, branches, forks, and the other basic of git and GitHub.

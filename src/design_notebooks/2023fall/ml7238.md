# Michael's Fall 2023 Design Notebook

## Week of September 11, 2023

Project Work:
* [MEM/WB Latch Module](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/pull/49): Completed and added the MEM/WB module and test to the core repository.
* [Control Module Design](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/actions/runs/6114327406): Started a detailed outline of how the control module will work.
  
This week was spent mostly working on the MEM/WB latch module as well as starting the detailed outline describing how the general control module will work. I also spent some time cleaning up the repository by fixing spelling mistakes, removing old assignments, and more so that it is ready for the new semester and new students. Overall, the Core repo is now in a place where new students can easily be on-boarded into Core and given a task to work on.

At this point all the outlines for the simpler modules are completed, which means I need to start finalizing the designs of things like the branch predictor, caches, and more. For very complex modules like the general control module, I plan to have more detailed descriptions of their functionality in addition to the standard outlines. As mentioned, I have started the one for the general control module and others will hopefully follow soon. I am also hoping this semester that one or two of the students on the Core team will have enough experience to be able to help me with design decisions and outlining; this is especially true regarding double-checking work and troubleshooting. As more of the core is completed, fixing bugs in module interaction or instruction execution will require someone with detailed knowledge of the overall design, and I'd like to be able to delegate bug fixing and troubleshooting to other people so that it doesn't take up all my time and slow down our progress.

## Week of September 18, 2023

Project Work:
* [Added More Instruction Decoding Detail to General Control Module Documentation](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/commit/210827f956ca855883031ee3402a26ae4708033e): Added more specified output details to the different instruction types.
* [Merged Hazard Detection Module into General Control Module](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/commit/4e8ccf7310ae49454d8b36c4377737d8aab21523): Decided to merge the hazard detection module into the general control module to reduce redundant inputs and registers, since both modules would have had very similar inputs and internal registers. Started documenting the hazard detection functionality in the general control module functionality document.
* [Added NOP instruction description to General Control Module Documentation](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/commit/bce8dd3e52b0774d6eb3f71852de27794c9c350d): Added the decoding steps for the NOP instruction that will be used to stall the pipeline to prevent data hazards.
* [Updated ID/EX Latch Docs](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/commit/1c681230fc072e42237b54ab1ce0131fedf96714): Updated the ID/EX Latch Documentation with the new a_sel line and new values for b_sel line to allow the Load Upper IMM and Add Upper IMM to PC instructions to work.
* [Fixed Branch Evaluator Docs](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/commit/7443972dffcd0d2548776b7edbf27b8c1a1f37e5): Fixed the way the ALU output for branch conditions 1 and 2 is evaluated. Instead of taking the full output, it is now bitwise ORed together to get either a 1 or 0.
* [Moved Branch Prediction to ID phase](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/commit/c24b757b02da6a75e164b53b0e338213eb02f5fc): Updated the Branch Address Calculator to output the predicted next program counter value so that it can be immediately fed back to the program counter, making branch prediction happen in the ID phase rather than the EX phase.
* [Updated CPU Block Diagram](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/commit/c09d756adda8aac37d928cf1a273eb772b7df26f): Updated the CPU Block Diagram in the ReadMe to reflect the changes made to the general control module, merging the hazard detection module into the general control module, the new inputs for the branch address calculator module, the new a_sel line for the ID/EX latch, and the new pc_en line for the program counter.
* [Merged Uma's General Purpose Register Module](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/pull/51): Worked with Uma to remind her of the changes she needed to make to the register module and then merged her completed module and test into the core repo.

This week was primarily spent working on the documentation for the General Control Module. I added more specific output details to each instruction type as well as merged the hazard detection logic into the General Control Module. Most of the details for the instruction have now been added and what remains should be added shortly. In terms of the complete documentation for all functions of the General Control Module, I'd give a rough estimate that we are 40% complete, as while instruction decoding is almost fully documented, I have only just started on the data hazard detection portion of the documentation and have not yet started on handling branch prediction hazards, how the branch manager and control module will interact to deal with branching hazards and flushing the pipeline, or how to handle initialization of the core on startup.

While updating the Control Module Documentation, I discovered several oversights I made in the overall core design regarding the execution of specific instructions and branch prediction. To fix the instruction oversights, I added a few more control lines to select new parameters that would allow instructions such as Load Upper IMM to function properly. I also realized that if I moved branch prediction handling from the branch manager to the branch address calculator, we could save an entire clock cycle and predict in the ID phase rather than the EX phase.

Finding and fixing various oversights in the core design reinforced the idea that I need to find one or two knowledgeable Core Team members to meet with and give a detailed overview of the RISC-V ISA and current core design so that they can help make design decisions, help troubleshoot, and most importantly, double check my work so that mistakes are caught and correctly early on. Thankfully, we have a much larger team this semester so I am hopeful I'll be able to find one or two students with enough initiative and aptitude to take on this responsibility.

## Week of September 25, 2023

Project Work:
* [Added NPC to Outline of Branch Manager Module](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/commit/206c04fbb02cfed3a17b0fa593118dc4f3337808): Added npc output the outline for the Branch Manager Module.
* [Updated wbs numbering](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/commit/60bbc415a163fbafc49267efe5393c17ea06f409): Updated the numbering for the wbs input to the MEM/WB Latch Module so that we can just use the func3 directly from the instruction to determine wbs for the different load sizes.
* [Updated General Control Module Complex Functionality Document](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/commit/ca0599d3d4bd9e80b6fcb318fa7281c9ff4da2fc): Updated the complex functionality document for the General Control Module with more outputs for the I instructions, NPC input, and pc_en output.
* [Started Complex Functionality Outline for Branch Prediction Module](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/commit/69236c1b072599031cd8495b9cc3a82ba3971fb7): Started the basic outline for the Complex Functionality document for the Branch Prediction Module.

This week was spent on a variety of things, most of which were design documentation-related. I continued my work on the functionality documentation for the General Control Module, adding missing inputs and outputs and continuing to fill in the various instruction decode outputs. I also started work on the functionality documentation for the Branch Prediction Module as I now have most of the components surrounding it finalized so I can begin working on its functionality in more detail. 

I also did some optimization to the MEM/WB latch's wbs input. This input determines the source of the data written to the destination register and my initial numbering system proved to be inefficient when trying to decode the load instructions. While adding the General Control Module outputs for the load instructions, I realized that the func3 of the load instruction could directly correspond to the wbs, and so changed the wbs numbering scheme to be a direct 1-1 with the func3 numbering of the Load instructions, with the wbs number corresponding to the ALU, something not used by the load instructions, neatly corresponding to the unused load func3 value of 3.

The new members who joined this semester should hopefully start finishing their labs next week, meaning implementation of the already outlined modules and the needed interfaces should pick up. On-boarding people to Core should be relatively smooth as there is plenty of detailed implementation work they can go ahead and start.

## Week of October 2, 2023

Project Work:
* [Updated Branch Prediction Complex Functionality Document](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/pull/55): Updated the complex functionality document for the Branch Prediction Module with additional sub-headings, the branch_taken output, and branch_occr input.
* [Added Folder and Draft Outline for Connection Modules](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/actions/runs/6422913955): Added a folder for and started the general outline template for connection modules that will be used to connect the various modules that make up the core.
* [Added Folder and Draft Outline for Interfaces](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/actions/runs/6422608689): Added a folder for and started the general outline template for interfaces that will be used to help connect the various modules that make up the core.
* [Added New Issues for Interfaces and Connection Modules](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/issues): Started adding issues for the various interfaces and connection modules that need to be outlined and built.
* [Created General Core Tasks Project](https://github.com/orgs/NYU-Processor-Design/projects/7): Created the General Core Tasks project to keep track of and document the various broad and generalized tasks that need to be accomplished.
* [Updated CPU Block Diagram](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/actions/runs/6423458944): Updated the CPU block diagram to have more room at the edges so wires at the edges don't disappear when using dark mode, and increased the resolution of the diagram.
* [Added Core Info to Lab 7](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-processor-design.github.io/commit/0ccb3da1afc759244c9b01bf0e3a871d25b0c5e7): Added Core Team information to Lab 7.
* [Merged Uma's EX/MEM Latch Module](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/actions/runs/6426252161): Worked with Uma to troubleshoot her EX/MEM Latch module and then merged her completed module and test into the core repo.

This week was another documentation-heavy one, with much of the focus being on adding outlines and issues for interfaces and higher-level modules used to connect the base modules, which I'm calling connection modules. Dedicated folders were added for interface outlines and connection module outlines respectively, and I made draft outline templates for both. With the groundwork for that documentation laid down, I've delegated the task of refining and finishing the outline templates to Uma, as she is the Doc Czar. Once the templates are complete, I can start filling out the information for individual interfaces and connection modules. I also created issues for various interfaces and connection modules and added them to the Core Design and Implementation project. There are still many interfaces and connection modules that need to be solidified and turned into issues, something I'm hoping the eventual new Core Team members will be able to help with.

I also continued my work this week on documenting the functionality of the various complex modules, with most of the work going into the Branch Prediction module. However, I did not get much done with it other than improving the general outline and finishing the current inputs and outputs as the interface and connection module documentation took up most of my time this week.

As it stands, we are still waiting for the new members to finish the onboarding labs. Hopefully, I can get some interfaces outlined for easy implementation, as many of the simpler core modules have already been implemented. There is still a lot of design work that needs to be done however, so I am hopeful that one or two students will be up to the challenge and be able to help work on things like the cache and various interfaces needed.

## Week of October 9, 2023

Project Work:
* [Outlined ID Interface](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/pull/84): Outlined the ID Interface which connects the IF/ID Latch module to the ID/EX Latch module.
* [Outlined MEM Interface](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/pull/87): Outlined the MEM Interface which connects the EX/MEM Latch module to the MEM/WB Latch module.
* [Updated General Control Module Docs](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/pull/86): Updated the Complex Functionality Document for the General Control Module with the output decode information for I Type 3 instructions and added a section for hazard detection logic.
* [Merged Uma's EX Interface Outline](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/pull/85): Merged Uma's outline for the EX Interface connecting the ID/EX Latch and EX/MEM Latch modules.
* [Changed Documentation Folders Names](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/pull/89): Changed the name of the documentation folders to align with the formatting used for the documentation files they contain.

This week was spent mostly working on outlines for interfaces. I'm trying to get some more ready-to-implement tasks ready for when new students join so there is plenty for them to work on. We were able to get the outlines for all the latch-to-latch interfaces done this week so that is a good start. I also continued the work on the complex functionality outline for the General Control Module which is making good progress. I'm hoping the new members are going to be ready to join teams soon as progress has been slow with just me, Uma, and Rielle working on Core, especially when Uma and Rielle also have documentation responsibilities.

## Week of October 16, 2023

Project Work:
* [Added Pipeline Reset Module Outline](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/pull/98); Changed the Processor State Module to the Pipeline Reset Module, which handles flushing the pipeline after an incorrect branch prediction. I also finished the outline for the Pipeline Reset Module.
* [Updated General Control Module Docs](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/pull/99): Removed the P-State, npc, and flush inputs as flushing is now handled by the Pipelijne Reset Module which has replaced the Processor State Module.
* [Completed Several Interface Outlines](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/pull/101): Completed the outlines for the Branch Manager Input Interface, Data Cache Manager Control Interface, ALU Operands Interface, Destination Register Info Interface, Source Register Numbers Interface, and Source Register Data Interface.
* [Onboarded Surya](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/issues/17): Onboarded Surya to the core team and assigned them the L1 Cache design.
* [Added Issue and Start of Outline for CSR Counters and Registers Module](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/actions/runs/6565234536): Added an issue and blank outline document for the CSR Counters and Registers module that is needed for some of the system level instructions.
* [Added Issue Start of Outline for Flush Bus Interface](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/actions/runs/6565287165): Added an issue blank outline document for the Flush Bus Interface.

The majority of this week was spent creating and finishing outlines for various interfaces and replacing the Processor State Module with the Pipeline Reset Module. Most of the major ready-to-implement interfaces are now fully outlined and can be implemented, meaning there is plenty of work for new students to do once they are onboarded. I also finally decided what to do with the Processor State Module, opting to replace it with the Pipeline Reset Module which will handle forwarding the next program counter address to the program counter and handle flushing and resetting the pipeline.

Core Team onboarding finally started this week, with people finishing the labs. Surya was the first new member to be onboarded this semester and they expressed a desire to work on designing the caches. I've assigned Surya the task of designing the L1 cache and we will see how that goes. I also communicated with Charan who expressed a desire to join the Core Team after they finish the onboarding labs.

## Week of October 23, 2023

Project Work:
* [Finished Flush Bus Interface Outline](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/pull/104): Finished the outline for the Flush Bus interface.
* [Helped Rielle with Branch Address Calculator](): Reminded Rielle of how to test her Branch Address Calculator module.

Due to being in the midst of several midterm projects, I was not able to get a lot done this week. However, I did manage to make time to finish the Flush Bus interface outline and to help Rielle with her module testing. We now have quite a few modules and interfaces ready and waiting to be implemented which is good for when more people start to join the Core Team.

Speaking of people joining the Core Team, I did expect we would have more people finished with the labs and joining teams at this point in the semester. I have had two people reach out so far, which is good, but we are going to need a lot more people soon so we can start working away at implementation and the rest of the design work.

## Week of October 30, 2023

Project Work:
* [Finished Branch Prediction Outline](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/pull/108): Finalized the method of branch prediction and finished the functionality document and outline for the Branch Prediction Module.
* [Removed Branch Taken Input and Output from EX/MEM Latch](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/commit/db09c16bca30d053fd52123d9a7cc06e5b76a34b): Removed the Branch Taken Input and Output from the EX/MEM Latch Module since changes made to the Branch Manager Module made latching the branch taken value redundant.
* [Removed Combinational Logic From Branch Manager Outline](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/commit/b11bc18fbf1f4f1f04f87094d312e118bb4d3237): Removed the combinational logic that handled setting the flush signal from the Branch Manager module outline and replaced it with clocked sequential logic that should be less prone to errors and timing issues.
* [Updated CPU Block Diagram](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/commit/d2d7e9eb02c146980739b32d17a1df73dbd09de0): Updated the CPU block diagram to reflect the various changes made to modules such as removing Branch Taken from the EX/MEM Latch and the new inputs and outputs needed for the completed Branch Predictor.
* [Helped Troubleshoot and Merged Rielle's Branch Address Calculator Module](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/pull/107): Helped Rielle troubleshoot some Codecov issues and then merged her completed Branch Address Calculator Module.

The majority of this week was spent on finalizing the branch prediction module. I decided to go with a 2-bit branch predictor which required a few new inputs to be added to the module. Both the functionality description and the module outline are now completed for the branch predictor so it is ready to be implemented. While finalizing the branch predictor, I also made some changes to the Branch Manager and EX/MEM modules. Originally, the branch_taken signal was latched into the EX/MEM Latch and then passed to the Branch Manager in the MEM phase where combinational logic would control the flush signal. However, I realized I could instead pass the branch_taken signal directly into the Branch Manager in the EX phase and then use sequential logic for the flush signal rather than combinational to achieve the same result of flush being set in the MEM phase without the timing issues of the combinational approach. Rielle was also able to finish her work on the Branch Address Calculator which was good so I was able to merge that into the main repo. 

## Week of November 6. 2023

Project Work:
* [Implemented ID/EX Latch Module](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/pull/110): Implemented the module and test cases for the ID/EX Latch.
* [Implemented Branch Predictor Module](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/pull/111): Implemented the module and test cases for the Branch Predictor.
* [Started Work on the Branch Manager Module](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/pull/112/commits/8407eed06ff364ed7b70b9a11a3afc5376599f82): Started work on the implementation of and tests for the Branch Manager.
* [Commented on Surya's initial L1 Cache PR](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/pull/109): Reviewed Surya's initial PR for the L1 cache and reminded them to fill out the L1 Cache outline and design a test for the L1 Cache.

This week was mostly spent on implementing the ID/EX Latch and Branch Predictor modules as well as starting work on the Branch Manager module. After not touching implementation for several weeks in the hopes that easy implementation tasks would encourage new members to join the team and quickly get to work, it is clear that approach was unsuccessful and we'll just need to go full steam ahead with the 4 current members, hopefully soon to be 5, committed to Core Team work. In terms of implementation, Uma has started work on the EX and Source Register Data interfaces so those should hopefully be complete soon. Once we get several interfaces complete we'll be able to tackle all the otherwise fully functional modules that still need to be interfaced and then test the functionality of several modules together. Surya has also continued work on the L1 Cache, completing the Verilog implementation and complex functionality description. Once Surya finishes the L1 Cache outline and tests that should be another module implemented.

At this point in the semester, I am quite concerned that I have only had 2 new students reach out to work on Core, one of which has yet to complete the labs. At this point in the semester, everyone should have finished the onboarding labs quite a while ago and be well integrated into a repo team to work on implementing and/or designing components. I'm going to make the best of the current situation as I have no other choice, but I'd like to find a way to get more of the new students engaged and joining teams.

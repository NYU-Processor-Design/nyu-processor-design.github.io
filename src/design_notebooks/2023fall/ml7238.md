## Week of September 11, 2023

Project Work:
* [MEM/WB Latch Module](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/pull/49): Completed and added the MEM/WB module and test to the core repository.
* [Control Module Design](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/actions/runs/6114327406): Started a detailed outline of how the control module will work.
  
This week was spent mostly working on the MEM/WB latch module as well as starting the detailed outline describing how the general control module will work. I also spent some time cleaning up the repository by fixing spelling mistakes, removing old assignments, and more so that it is ready for the new semester and new students. Overall, the Core repo is now in a place where new students can easily be on-boarded into Core and given a task to work on.

At this point all the outlines for the simpler modules are completed, which means I need to start finalizing the designs of things like the branch predictor, caches, and more. For very complex modules like the general control module, I plan to have more detailed descriptions of their functionality in addition to the standard outlines. As mentioned, I have started the one for the general control module and others will hopefully follow soon. I am also hoping this semester that one or two of the students on the Core team will have enough experience to be able to help me with design decisions and outlining; this is especially true regarding double checking work and troubleshooting. As more of the core is completed, fixing bugs in module interaction or instruction execution will require someone with detailed knowledge of the overall design, and I'd like to be able to delegate bug fixing and troubleshooting to other people so that it doesn't take up all my time and slow down our progress.

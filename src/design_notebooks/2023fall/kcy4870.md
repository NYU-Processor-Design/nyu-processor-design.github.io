# Kevin's Design Notebook
----

## Week of 11 September 2023
  * Refreshed my knowledge on the AHB and APB
  * Discussed plans for AHB and APB issue ordering with Rishyak, Krzysztof, and Vito
  * Created some APB issues that need to have more descriptions eventually

This week was spent getting reacquainted with the AHB and APB specifications and discussing the roadmap for AMBA in general with the leadership. We have decided that the APB should be pushed back a little but until more work is done with the AHB since the APB is very similar to the AHB. Next week will be spent looking over code that we have already and maybe adding more unit tests to the subordinate module.

## Week of 18 September 2023
 * [APB GPIO Subordinate](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-amba/issues/19): Started working on interfaces and test files for GPIO

This week I spent creating the basic files and figuring out which signals are necessary for the APB and how they are different from the AHB. Both protocols are very similar but the APB lacks a lot of the fancy features of the AHB. This behavior also changes how the subordinate works (also called the Completer in the documentation ) so I decided it might be better to start from scratch while loosely referencing the AHB subordinate.

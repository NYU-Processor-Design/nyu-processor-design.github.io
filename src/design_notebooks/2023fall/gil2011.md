# Rielle's Design Notebook
This is Rielle, finance czar and chequebook person.

If you ever need to find me on campus, look for the short Asian with a pink cane.

## Week of September 10, 2023
### Project Work
- Filled out Rising Violets forms to get extra money (maybe) and sent follow-up emails to Sam to figure out what in heck is happening with monthly meetings (still pending response...)
### Comments
Taking note that this will be a super McFkn busy sem for me as leadership of another club and a having part-time job, I'm going to put a lot of upcoming deadlines directly in this notebook so in the event that I forget to tell anyone verbally we won't just miss important dates :)

With that said, the budget forms are due 9/20 and thus I need to follow up on that sometime this upcoming week

This coming week I'm also going to try to resume core work and not just be a finance person that contributes nothing else :p

# Thu's Design Notebook
---

Hello, World! Welcome to my notebook.

## Week of 11 September 2023
Project work:
* [Onboarding Lab 1] (https://github.com/thuvu17/processor-design-lab-1.git): Completed Lab 1

This week was spent getting used to using Git on command line, learning and settting up virtual environments, installing the required tools for the labs, and completing onboarding lab 1.

I think the lab was a good introduction to toolchain. The document was very detailed and super helpful. I just learnt about CMake and Make during OS this same week so it was nice to get to chance to put some of my new knowledge to use!

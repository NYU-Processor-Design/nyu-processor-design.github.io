# Thu's Design Notebook
---

Hello, World! Welcome to my notebook.

## Week of 11 September 2023
Project work:
* [Onboarding Lab 1](https://github.com/thuvu17/processor-design-lab-1.git): Completed Lab 1

This week was spent getting used to using Git on command line, learning and settting up virtual environments, installing the required tools for the labs, and completing onboarding lab 1.

I think the lab was a good introduction to toolchain. The document was very detailed and super helpful. I just learnt about CMake and Make during OS this same week so it was nice to get to chance to put some of my new knowledge to use!

## Week of 2 October 2023
Project work:
* [Onboarding Lab 2](https://github.com/thuvu17/onboarding-lab-2.git): Completed Lab 2

Last week I was away on a conference so I didn't get a chance to work on Lab 2. This week was spent reviewing Verilog, running the tests from Onboarding Lab 2.

I realize I've forgotten quite a bit (lot) of Verilog, but I'm now more confident after completing the lab. Next week, I'll catch up on Lab 3+4.

## Week of 9 October 2023
Project work:
* [Onboarding Lab 3](https://github.com/thuvu17/onboarding-lab-3.git): Working on Lab 3

Struggling a bit with the first few exercises, will review some concepts and finish the lab next week

# Week of 16 October 2023
Project work:
* [Onboarding Lab 3](https://github.com/thuvu17/onboarding-lab-3.git): Completed Lab 3

Finished Lab 3. Took quite some time at first but after I got through the first 2 exercises the rest was straightforward. Felt a lot more comfortable with testing now.

# Week of 23 October 2023
Project work:
* [Onboarding Lab 4](https://github.com/thuvu17/onboarding-lab-4.git): Started Lab 4

 Working on Lab 4. Have been pretty busy with work so will be updating the notebook a bit late...

# Week of 30 October 2023
Project work:
* [Onboarding Lab 4](https://github.com/thuvu17/onboarding-lab-4.git): Completed Lab 4
  
Finished lab 4. 

# Week of 6-13 November 2023
Project work:
* **Lab 5:** Advanced System Verilog
* [The Realm of Confusion: Object Kinds in SystemVerilog](https://blog.vito.nyc/posts/sv-types/): Further reading
  
Read through Onboarding Lab 5 and blog post on SystemVerilog. Was super helpful, I realized there's a lot about Verilog I didn't know since I just naturally picked up on the language. No exercise for this lab.

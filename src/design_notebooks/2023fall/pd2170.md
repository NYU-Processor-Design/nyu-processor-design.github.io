# Pingchuan's Design Notebook
--------
Hello! This is Pingchuan's Notebook.

## Week 1 (Sept. 18 - Sept.25)

Tasks: 
* [Onboarding Lab 1](https://github.com/dpcarry/Processor_Labs/tree/main/lab1): Completed Lab 1

### Comments
This week, I installed vm for linux system, completed the cmake lab in the linux environment.
Ran into a few issues during the building process, and mistook CML as commandline instead of CMakeLists.
Pay more attention to commit message conventions.
Starting to do lab 2 and will finish it by the end of week 2.

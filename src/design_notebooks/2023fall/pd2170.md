# Pingchuan's Design Notebook
--------
Hello! This is Pingchuan's Notebook.

## Week 1 (Sept. 18 - Sept.25)

Tasks: 
* [Onboarding Lab 1](https://github.com/dpcarry/Processor_Labs/tree/main/lab1): Completed Lab 1

### Comments
This week, I installed vm for linux system, completed the cmake lab in the linux environment.
Ran into a few issues during the building process, and mistook CML as commandline instead of CMakeLists.
Pay more attention to commit message conventions.
Starting to do lab 2 and will finish it by the end of week 2.

## Week 2 (Sept.25 - Oct.2)

### Tasks:
* [Onboarding Lab 2](https://github.com/dpcarry/onboarding-lab-2/tree/dpc): Completed Lab 2

### Comments
This week, I refreshed my memory on verilog, and got a bit confused about the different variable names, namely logic, reg, and wire. 
logic is often used to represent individual bits or signals in digital circuits, and it represents a single binary value that can be either 0 or 1.
reg is a data type used to declare registers or storage elements in Verilog. Registers can store and retain values over time.
wire  is a data type used to represent a continuous signal or connection between logic gates or components. It carries values from one point in a circuit to another.
Starting to do lab 3 and will finish soon.

## Week 3 (Oct.2 - Oct.9)

### Tasks:
* Still finishing up lab.

### Comments
This week, I was caught up in a busy work schedule, and was confused about writing verification codes. Aiming to finish lab 3 by the end of next week.

## Week 4 (Oct.9 - Oct.16)

### Tasks:
* [Onboarding Lab 3](https://github.com/dpcarry/onboarding-lab-3/tree/lab3): Completed Lab 3

### Comments
This week, I continued to work on verification codes. The idea of verification code is new to me so it took me some time to understand.
Strategy of writing verification tests: implement the verilog modules as c++ functions first, then come up with a testing strategy to verify. For Don't Care variables, the test needs to show that it really is irrelevant by testing an amount of possible values for it.
Starting to do lab 4 and will finish soon, but may be a bit late because of the midterms.

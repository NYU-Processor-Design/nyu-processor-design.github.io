# Pingchuan's Design Notebook
--------
Hello! This is Pingchuan's Notebook.

## Week 1 (Sept. 18 - Sept.25)

Tasks: 
* [Onboarding Lab 1](https://github.com/dpcarry/Processor_Labs/tree/main/lab1): Completed Lab 1

### Comments
This week, I installed vm for linux system, completed the cmake lab in the linux environment.
Ran into a few issues during the building process, and mistook CML as commandline instead of CMakeLists.
Pay more attention to commit message conventions.
Starting to do lab 2 and will finish it by the end of week 2.

## Week 2 (Sept.25 - Oct.2)

### Tasks:
* [Onboarding Lab 2](https://github.com/dpcarry/onboarding-lab-2/tree/dpc): Completed Lab 2

### Comments
This week, I refreshed my memory on verilog, and got a bit confused about the different variable names, namely logic, reg, and wire. 
logic is often used to represent individual bits or signals in digital circuits, and it represents a single binary value that can be either 0 or 1.
reg is a data type used to declare registers or storage elements in Verilog. Registers can store and retain values over time.
wire  is a data type used to represent a continuous signal or connection between logic gates or components. It carries values from one point in a circuit to another.
Starting to do lab 3 and will finish soon.

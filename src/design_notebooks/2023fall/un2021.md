Project Work:
* [CPU General Registers](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/issues/5) Implementation no longer complete

This week was realizing I did not finish the General Registers from last semester, and also discovering that it was unfortunately un-committed - completely slipped my mind to finish it this week, but I found my old module/test files and I'm hoping to *actually* wrap it up by next week.

## Week of 18 September 2023

Project Work:
* [CPU General Registers]([https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/issues/5](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/pull/51)) Implementation complete :)

After being reminded of old Discord conversations and making silly code typos, I finished the implementation of the registers by adjusting how Register 0 worked, and testing accordingly (with three different commits, sorry Michael). Next week, I want to fix an additional issue with the program counter and also start developing a new component.

I also need to resume Docs work so I'm not slacking on my Czar responsibilities.

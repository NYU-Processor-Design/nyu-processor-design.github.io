## Week of 11 September 2023

Project Work:
* [CPU General Registers](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-core/issues/5) Implementation no longer complete

This week was realizing I did not finish the General Registers from last semester, and also discovering that it was unfortunately un-committed - completely slipped my mind to finish it this week, but I found my old module/test files and I'm hoping to *actually* wrap it up by next week.

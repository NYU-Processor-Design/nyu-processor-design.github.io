# Darren's Design Notebook

Hi, I'm Darren a sophomore in Electrical Engineering and this is my first design notebook.

## Weeks of September 15-29 2023
#### Project Work
* Looked at the VIP website to see what were the first steps

These few weeks were spent on learning and refreshing some of the basics of git such as how to create a fork, local repo, and proper pull request. I ran into some initial issues with working with git, but am slowly figuring it out. Got quite busy with the start of the semester and was unable to follow up on help with github forks and repos. I don't have too much planned for this VIP as I haven't finished a course on digital logic so most of this is still foreign to me but I do hope to get through some of the onboarding labs. Also will look into github commit message conventions.

## Week of October 6, 2023
#### Project Work
* Setup Development Environment
* Started on Lab 1
  
This week I started working on Lab 1, however ran into some roadblocks with getting some of the development environment setup. Also had some issues with working with CMake as it is a language that I am unfamiliar with. I was able to get some parts of the Lab done such as getting the version of CMake and printing "Hello World". I was still unable to get WSL to work on my computer as something was wrong with Virtualization not being enabled even though I went through the troubleshooting steps, I will resume work through my laptop for the future.

## Week of October 13, 2023
#### Project Work
* Continued Lab 1
  
This week as I worked more on Lab 1, I realized that I needed to learn more about Cmake so I watched some videos online to help me better understand the basics of Cmake. Looking at the lab documentation on the Github was not enough as I was unable to get the files to in different folders. In particular I ran into some issues of trying to separate the build file in the directory to be able to execute the make command correctly. Also needed to learn how to code "Hello World" in C++ as it is another language that I have not programmed in before.

## Week of October 20, 2023
#### Project Work
* Continued Lab 1
  
This week I continued to work on Lab 1, having finished Part 1 successfully after figuring out the separation of folders needed to run the command cmake properly without cluttering the parent directory. I struggled with the first step of part 2 where I start to build a program, I misread the documentation and tried running the commands in the terminal directly and kept getting errors. After finally realizing my mistake, I put the 2 commands into my cmakelist.txt file. Then I struggled to get cmake to generate the Ninja build system. I ran into an error of "CMake was unable to find a build program", and I looked online for solutions. Then I was able to install Ninja and was able to run the commands.

## Week of October 27, 2023
#### Project Work
* Continued Lab 1

This week I started on Part 3 of Lab 1, where I needed to learn how to program a function in C++ and understand how to call functions in C++. After creating a function to ask for a name and incorporating it within my hello world file, I was able to compile with Ninja and get an executable linked. Also needed to refresh my memory on to commit changes to git. Finished the coding aspect of Lab 1.
## Week of November 3, 2023
#### Project Work
* Finished [Lab 1](https://github.com/dareminion/proc-design)
  
This week I finished Lab 1 as after finishing the coding aspects of it, I needed to learn more about how to use markdown to properly answer the questions for Lab 1 In the ReadME file and to further improve my design notebook. Using the tutorial on markdown on their own website I was able to properly work on the notes and questions for lab 1 and made edits to my design notebook.

## Week of November 10, 2023
#### Project Work
* Looked at Lab 2

This week I took a look at what I would need to do for lab 2 and realized that I needed to learn a lot more about Verilog and basic digital logic gates in order for me to continue with this Lab and VIP. The material being taught in my Digital Logic lab only covered the basics and I needed to know more for this lab.

## Week of November 17, 2023

This week I was unable to work or look at anything for the project as I was busy with midterms. Will begin to look at Verilog tutorials to start with the basics.

## Week of November 24, 2023
#### Project Work
* Updated Design Notebook

This week was Thanksgiving break so not too much time to do anything to intensive. Did come and update various parts of my design notebook where small typos and errors were present. I have learned more about the basics of Verilog through a combination of in class Labs for my digital logic class and some online tutorials and guides.

## Week of December 1, 2023
#### Project Work
*Fixed development environment

This week I ran into further issues working in WSL as some errors with virtualization was an issue. Spent a while looking online through forums and going through quite a few settings on my laptop. After some time I was able to fix it, just through disabling and re-enabling certain settings a few times until it just worked again. 

## Week of December 8, 2023
#### Project Work
*Look into next steps
*Looked into Verilog of xor and nand gates.

This week I started to think about what I should learn next to be able to help myself to be able to more in this project. Having finished a course in Digital Logic I still feel that I am unable to work even the onboarding labs, so I hope to learn more about Verilog over the Winter. I also started to learn about Verilog for XOR and NAND gates as I did not work with them that much in labs. Also noticed throughout onboarding Lab 1 that I did not know enough about languages such as C++ to be able to work on this VIP. Hopefully after taking a course in C++ next semester I will be better equipped for this VIP.

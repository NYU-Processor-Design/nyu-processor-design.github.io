# Darren's Design Notebok

Hi, I'm Darren a sophomore in Electrical Engineering and this is my first design notebook.

## Weeks of 15 - 29 September 2022

This week was spent on learning and refreshing some of the basics of git such as how to create a fork, local repo, and proper pull request. I ran into some initial issues with working with git, but am slowly figuring it out. I am behind on the onboarding labs and hope to complete onboarding labs 1 and 2 soon.

### Comments
-Got quite busy at one point and was unable to follow up for help on working with github forks and repos

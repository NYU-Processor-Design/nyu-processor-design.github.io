# James Xie's Design Notebook

## week of Feb. 10
Created Design Notebook

## Week of Feb. 24
Discussed with team member about next step forwared. 
The current plan is to have the core, RAM, and ROM working so that we can assemble a working processor.

## Week of Feb. 31
The core is still failing some tests. If the problems with the core cannot be solved then we must drop our
current design and switch to a simpler version.

## Week of March 10
The RAM and ROM are now able to be generated using OpenRAM scripts. The next step is to write tests to verify that
the generated RAM is working. Still no updates on the core. 

## Week of March 17
No work done due to midterms

## Week of 10 February 2025

Project Work:
  * Completed Creating Github account and design notebook.

This week was mostly spent on figuring out how to use git to upload files and other content to github.

I am struggling with environment setup. I might need to upgrade my OS system and other software to sucessfully setup the environment.

Created my design notebook 

## week 2 of 20 Febuary 2025

Meeting with the team and decided the meeting date and time for the future. Learned some comp arch about how a CPU works. Waiting the team to decided what to do and when to start the mini project.

## week 3 of 27 Febuary 2025

Meet with the team on Tuesday and learn more about the mini-project. The project required the knowledge to program different components of the CPU which I have no prior experience with, going to learn how to do those over the weekend. 

## week 4 of 6 March 2025

Started the mini project and I am going to program the ALU for the mini project, going to review the Verilog and the structure of ALU over the weekend. 

## week 5 of 13 March 2025

The ALU has some mistakes as the opcode doesn't enter the ALU, the ALU receives the code from the control unit. So I need to read the pdf more carefully in the future. Going to fix the mistake over the weekend.

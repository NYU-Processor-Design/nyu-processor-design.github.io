# Noah Mays-Smith's Design Notebook

## Week One:
Created first design notebook
## Week Three: (Forgot Week 2 I Think Oops)
Project Work:
Met with my group, Hongtai, Srijan, and Ben, and planned to meet once a week on Tuesdays to check in and assign work. This week we agreed to meet at the same time each week, found a resource, https://hdlbits.01xz.net/, to learn more about creating testbenches. Next week we're planning on assigning parts of the processor to work in in groups of 2.

# Noah Mays-Smith's Design Notebook

## Week One:
Created first design notebook
## Week Three: (Forgot Week 2 I Think Oops)
Project Work:
Met with my group, Hongtai, Srijan, and Ben, and planned to meet once a week on Tuesdays to check in and assign work. This week we agreed to meet at the same time each week, found a resource, https://hdlbits.01xz.net/, to learn more about creating testbenches. Next week we're planning on assigning parts of the processor to work in in groups of 2.

## Week Four:
Met and discussed project at the Thursday meeting.
Project Work:
Over the last week I focused on relearning more verilog and teaching myself how to write better tesstbenches.
Met with our group on Thusday, and reorganized from two smaller groups to one group, as Srijan was able to get most of the work done himself, so the rest of us will work on it together, asking for his help when we get stuck. We plan to each have a component of the processor done by Tuesday. I am going to be doing the data memory.

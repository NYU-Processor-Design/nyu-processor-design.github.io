# Sean Doyle Design Notebook

Welcome to my Spring 2023 design notebook.

## Week of 23 January 2023

Project Work:
* [Onboarding Lab 1](https://github.com/SPD3/Proc_Design_lab1): Completed Lab 1

I completed the first lab this week which was all about using cmake and make 
files. The lab went pretty smoothly for the most part however I could not get 
cmake to make the Ninja build system files. When I tried running the commands 
in the tutorial cmake came back to me with errors because I did not have the 
following set:
CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM
CMAKE_C_COMPILER
CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER
I believe these are just settings within the cmakelist file that need to be set 
so if we need to use ninja in the future I'm going to have to look into that. 
I also did not realize I should put the lab in a git repo to link it here so I 
ended up doing the lab in its own separate directory and copying to a git repo 
afterwards and making one big commit. As a result the repo linked here does not 
really show a natural progression of my work but that's just a first VIP 
notebook entry issue. Finally, I would normally set git to ignore the build 
directory but for the sake of showing I completed the lab I did not do this and 
included them in my commit. I'm not sure if this is the correct thing to do but 
it felt like it made sense. Overall the lab went pretty smoothly and I have a 
much better understanding of Cmake and make.

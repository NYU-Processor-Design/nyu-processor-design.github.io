# Sean Doyle Design Notebook

Welcome to my Spring 2023 design notebook.

## Week of 23 January 2023

Project Work:
* [Onboarding Lab 1](https://github.com/SPD3/Proc_Design_lab1): Completed Lab 1

I completed the first lab this week which was all about using cmake and make 
files. The lab went pretty smoothly for the most part however I could not get 
cmake to make the Ninja build system files. When I tried running the commands 
in the tutorial cmake came back to me with errors because I did not have the 
following set:
CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM
CMAKE_C_COMPILER
CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER
I believe these are just settings within the cmakelist file that need to be set 
so if we need to use ninja in the future I'm going to have to look into that. 
I also did not realize I should put the lab in a git repo to link it here so I 
ended up doing the lab in its own separate directory and copying to a git repo 
afterwards and making one big commit. As a result the repo linked here does not 
really show a natural progression of my work but that's just a first VIP 
notebook entry issue. Finally, I would normally set git to ignore the build 
directory but for the sake of showing I completed the lab I did not do this and 
included them in my commit. I'm not sure if this is the correct thing to do but 
it felt like it made sense. Overall the lab went pretty smoothly and I have a 
much better understanding of Cmake and make.

## Week of 30 January 2023

Project Work:
* [Onboarding Lab 2](https://github.com/SPD3/onboarding-lab-2): Completed Lab 2

I completed the second lab this week which was all about system Verilog and 
completing exercise related to it. The first exercise was not very hard, 
however I struggled with the second exercise. I had never used a Fibonacci 
Linear Feedback Shift Register before so I had to look online to see what it did. 
I started by following this site:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register
but I notices that the pseudo code in that website was putting bits into the 
output on the opposite end as what the test cases expected. I ended up looking 
at the test creation code to figure out the specifics of the algorithm (which
bits corresponded to which taps and what end of the output to append the new 
bit) because I couldn't get the pseudo code from the above website to pass the 
test cases.
I also struggled a little bit initially with exercise 3 because I thought I had 
to import the mystery modules on my own. I did not realize that they were 
automatically included until I looked at the cmake file so I spent a good 10 or 
15 minutes trying all possible pathways I could think of to import the mystery 
modules. :laughing:

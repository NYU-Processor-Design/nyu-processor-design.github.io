# Sean Doyle Design Notebook

Welcome to my Spring 2023 design notebook.

## Week of 23 January 2023

Project Work:
* [Onboarding Lab 1](https://github.com/SPD3/Proc_Design_lab1): Completed Lab 1

I completed the first lab this week which was all about using cmake and make
files. The lab went pretty smoothly for the most part however I could not get
cmake to make the Ninja build system files. When I tried running the commands
in the tutorial cmake came back to me with errors because I did not have the
following set:

CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM

CMAKE_C_COMPILER

CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER

I believe these are just settings within the cmakelist file that need to be set
so if we need to use ninja in the future I'm going to have to look into that.
I also did not realize I should put the lab in a git repo to link it here so I
ended up doing the lab in its own separate directory and copying to a git repo
afterwards and making one big commit. As a result the repo linked here does not
really show a natural progression of my work but that's just a first VIP
notebook entry issue. Finally, I would normally set git to ignore the build
directory but for the sake of showing I completed the lab I did not do this and
included them in my commit. I'm not sure if this is the correct thing to do but
it felt like it made sense. Overall the lab went pretty smoothly and I have a
much better understanding of Cmake and make.

## Week of 30 January 2023

Project Work:
* [Onboarding Lab 2](https://github.com/SPD3/onboarding-lab-2): Completed Lab 2

* [Onboarding Lab 1](https://github.com/SPD3/Proc_Design_lab1): Fixed Ninja build system in Lab 1

I completed the second lab this week which was all about system Verilog and
completing exercise related to it. The first exercise was not very hard,
however I struggled with the second exercise. I had never used a Fibonacci
Linear Feedback Shift Register before so I had to look online to see what it did.
I started by following [this site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register)
but I notices that the pseudo code in that website was putting bits into the
output on the opposite end as what the test cases expected. I ended up looking
at the test creation code to figure out the specifics of the algorithm (which
bits corresponded to which taps and what end of the output to append the new
bit) because I couldn't get the pseudo code from the above website to pass the
test cases.

I also struggled a little bit initially with exercise 3 because I thought I had
to import the mystery modules on my own. I did not realize that they were
automatically included until I looked at the cmake file so I spent a good 10 or
15 minutes trying all possible pathways I could think of to import the mystery
modules. :laughing:

After finishing lab 2 I went back and took another look at Lab 1. Based on the
discussion at our meeting this week I went to [this site](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ninja)
and installed ninja for my mac. After doing this I re-did the ninja section of
Lab 1 and had no errors!

## Week of 6 February 2023

Project Work:
* [Onboarding Lab 3](https://github.com/SPD3/onboarding-lab-3): Completed Lab 3

I completed the third lab this week which was all about testing. It went pretty
smoothly all things considered but I just ran into a bunch of small problems
that made things take longer. None of these were very significant, they were
were mostly me misunderstanding how the actual code was intended to work and as
a result my tests did not verify the code's function correctly. Also, for my
exercise 4 tests I decided to test all possible inputs which takes about 30
seconds to do. If this were production code I would likely modify these tests to
use randomness to pick a subset of inputs but I wanted to get a better feel for
the limits of bruteforce testing all possible inputs.

This week, I also created a script that automatically built, made, and ran the
tests within the toolchain because I got sick of typing cmake .., make, and
then the test command over and over again. Additionally I started to work on
some documentation for GitKraken which is the tool that I use to manage local
git repos.

## Week of 13 February 2023

Project Work:
* [Onboarding Lab 4](https://github.com/SPD3/onboarding-lab-4): Completed Lab 4

I completed the fourth lab this week. It went pretty well however at the very 
end I tried compiling my code by running cmake and for some reason it compiled 
for ninja not for make. I went back through the original tutorial, double checked 
all of my work and then tried running cmake again, and it still compiled for 
the ninja build system. I cleared my build directory and recompiled and only 
then it created a make file. I'm not sure why this occurred but it was pretty 
confusing for a bit. Other than this minor hiccup the lab was pretty 
self-explanatory and went well.


## Week of 20 February 2023

Project Work:
* [GitKraken Documentation](https://github.com/SPD3/nyu-processor-design.github.io/tree/GitKrakenDocumentation)

This week I began looking at the Risc-V documentation [here] (https://riscv.org), 
[here] (https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~ashriram/Courses/CS295/assets/notebooks/RISCV/RISCV_CARD.pdf),
and in the spec manual. Most of it I do not understand yet but mostly I was 
hoping to get acquainted with the resources that way when I do have questions in 
the future I know where to look for answers. I found that the core instructions 
link that I referenced above to be the most helpful as that gave me a good idea 
of all the functionality that we will have to implement.

I also continued working on the GitKraken documentation that I started a few 
weeks ago. I added sections on committing, pushing, pulling, merging, switching 
branches, and creating new branches so it is pretty close to ready. I think I 
will add a few more pictures and then beta test it on someone before putting in 
a PR. Not sure when this will be because I don't think this documentation is 
high priority but if I have some down time in the next few weeks it could be 
pretty soon.

## Week of 27 February 2023

Project Work:
* [Onboarding Lab 5](https://nyu-processor-design.github.io/getting_started/onboarding/06_advanced_sv.html)

This week I completed the fifth onboarding lab which was all about advanced 
System Verilog syntax. It made sense overall and I liked learning about 
interfaces and how they can be used to explicitly link Verilog components 
together. I didn't quite understand the difference between nets and variables 
because this section of the lab felt pretty technical and kind of flew over my 
head. It might have helped to see some examples so I might look up example code 
and add it to the lab to help others that struggled with this section too.

## Week of 6 March 2023

Project Work:
* [NYU-Mem Repository](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-mem)

This week I created the NYU-Mem repository. After talking with Vito I created 
the issues for the following tasks:
* Mapping out the interface between the memory controller and the HPB
* Implementing the memory control unit
* Creating a decoder for ROM/RAM
* Translating Hex to Verilog for ROM storage.

I then hopped on a call with Rishyak and Kevin and we looked over a PR that 
Rishyak had created for the mem repository that had an interface between the 
memory controller and HPB mapped out based on chats we had been having 
throughout the week. We deciding on adding a response flag but other than 
that kept what Rishyak had coded up.

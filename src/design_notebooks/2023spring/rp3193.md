# Rishyak's Design Notebook
This is Rishyak, he does processor-designer-ey things.

## Week of January 22, 2023
### Project Work
- [Onboarding Lab 1](https://github.com/rishyak/potential-computing-machine/tree/main/Labs/1): Completed lab 1 on toolchains
- [Onboarding Lab 2](https://github.com/rishyak/potential-computing-machine/tree/main/Labs/2): Completed lab 2 on SystemVerilog

### Comments
I met the processor design team during orientation on January 23, 2023. 

After much preparation, I started onboarding labs on January 27, 2023. I had 
to upgrade some dependencies but I was familiar with everything for lab 1.

I also finished the second onboarding lab on system verilog. I had to look up 
Fibonacci LFSRs and some Verilog syntax but the rest was fairly straightforward. 
I think it would be convenient if this lab had some more hand-holding. For example, 
a simpler example at the start for a quick revision on Verilog, or perhaps even
 a short explanation on LFSRs because CS majors don't really talk about them ever.

 Good labs.

All repositories could use a standardised contribution guideline to familiarise 
team members with team policies.

## Week of January 29, 2023
### Project Work
- [Onboarding Lab 3](https://github.com/rishyak/potential-computing-machine/tree/main/Labs/3): Completed lab 3 on verification
- [Repo Cleanup](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-processor-design.github.io/pull/12): Cleaned garbage files on repo
- [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-processor-design.github.io/pull/14): Added a Markdown cheatsheet for reference.
- Minor Fixes: Fixed [typos](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-processor-design.github.io/pull/16) and [missing URL's](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-processor-design.github.io/pull/37).

### Comments
I finished the last available onboarding lab at the moment. Verilator-based 
verification wasn't an issue for me since I have used both, Catch and Verilator
before. I faced an issue with exercise 3 which was the tiniest, silliest bug. 

Good lab. 

I don't expect people to have their text editors set up to format on save, so 
documentation should probably touch on that as well.

Fixed some tiny things I saw like extraneous files in repositories or typos or 
missing URL's. 

## Week of February 5, 2023
### Project Work
- [Onboarding Lab 4](https://github.com/rishyak/potential-computing-machine/tree/main/Labs/4): Completed lab 4 on verification toolchains

- [New position](https://nyu-processor-design.github.io/vip_course_docs/membership.html#czars): Czar of all things AMBA

### Comments
Finished the last currently available lab on verification toolchains. This was
easier than expected since I did a lot of the adaptation work last week already.
All I had to do was write the toolchains. 

I discovered that the instructions were missing a vital piece of information
which I spoke to teamleiter about. 

Good lab.

I feel iffy about just blindly using `nyu-cmake` and `nyu-util` so I'm gonna 
spend the week looking into that so I don't feel iffy about using them.

Got sick of the GitHub "community health" notifications and decided to make
a `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the entire team to follow.

I also created a VM for team-members looking for a native Linux experience
and a corresponding installation and usage guide.

In my quest to czar the AMBA department, I have finally caught up on all 
backlog so I can dedicate my week to memorising the AMBA manual and looking
into Verilog I know very little about. Shouldn't be too bad. 

## Week of February 12, 2023
### Project Work
- [Documentation](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-processor-design.github.io/pull/51): Cleaned up development environment documentation

### Comments
Dry week after the last one. I read some of APB manual but I was quickly reminded
to focus on homework that I keep procrastinating on.

Did some documentation clean-up and maintenance, but nothing too much otherwise.

## Week of February 19, 2023
### Project Work
- AMBA:
  - [AHB Interface](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-amba/pull/4): Updated the AMBA AHB interface
  - [APB Interface](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-amba/commit/0ce4077caa96d70cb11687d2c7aad079bc8249ae): Created the APB interface
  - [Toolchain](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-amba/commit/9063216a94d71ec91369a0e30277df804eb4f078): Cleaned up the toolchain on the repo
- [Git usage](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-processor-design.github.io/pull/72#issuecomment-1445229396): Helping people collaborate easier on Github

### Comments
Spent the week reading the AMBA manuals and implementing their interfaces. We
decided to implement burst transfers and protected transfers on the AHB. The APB
interface has been pushed too. The first step is to add a UART on the bus. Before
adding a UART, I want to spend time working on the AHB. 

Other than that, checked some PRs and left comments on how to use git easier. 
Those comments will be moved into a guide on the website for easier access some
time this week.

## Week of February 26, 2023

### Project Work
- [Onboarding Lab 5 (Part 1)](https://nyu-processor-design.github.io/getting_started/onboarding/06_advanced_sv.html): Read through the lab
- [AMBA](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-amba): Added a summary of AMBA components for new AMBA team members

### Comments
I went through the onboarding lab as soon as it was released. I knew a lot 
of it through my conversations with Vito or just looking things up. For example, 
I figured out what SystemVerilog interfaces are to work on the APB and AHB 
interfaces

I also wrote a summary of the AMBA components so new team members don't have to
parse the whole manual to work on their individual component. The purpose isn't
to avoid reading the specs, it's to provide context so they don't have to 
research things on their own. A dump of my current knowledge, in a way.

I also came up with action items for potential AMBA team members. They will be 
tracked on the repo's issues and on the projects page.

  - [Memory Interface](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-mem/pull/6): Set up the common memory interface to interface with the AHB subordinate

### Comments
I spent the week finishing finals week and checking out. However, I started 
working on the APB bridge, finalised the AMBA team for now, and did some 
general admin work for that repo. 

I consulted with documentation czar Uma for work on my repo. I also helped
Siddharth with the onboarding labs. 

My team will meet with Sean to discuss the
interface for the memory controller so it can interact with the AHB. I have a
general idea of what needs to be done, I just want to ensure we're on the same 
page. My general idea currently exists in a PR on [nyu-mem](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-mem).

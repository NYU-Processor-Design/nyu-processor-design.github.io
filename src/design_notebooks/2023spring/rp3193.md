### Comments
I met the processor design team during orientation on January 23, 2023. 

After much preparation, I started onboarding labs on January 27, 2023. I had to upgrade some dependencies but I was familiar with everything for lab 1.

All repositories could use a standardised contribution guideline to familiarise team members with team policies.

# Rishyak's Design Notebook

## Week of January 22, 2023
### Project Work
- [Onboarding Lab 1](https://github.com/rishyak/potential-computing-machine/tree/main/Labs/1): Completed lab 1 on toolchains
- [Onboarding Lab 2](https://github.com/rishyak/potential-computing-machine/tree/main/Labs/2): Completed lab 2 on SystemvVerilog

### Comments
I met the processor design team during orientation on January 23, 2023. 

After much preparation, I started onboarding labs on January 27, 2023. I had 
to upgrade some dependencies but I was familiar with everything for lab 1.

I also finished the second onboarding lab on system verilog. I had to look up 
Fibonacci LFSRs and some Verilog syntax but the rest was fairly straightforward. 
I think it would be convenient if this lab had some more hand-holding. For example, 
a simpler example at the start for a quick revision on Verilog, or perhaps even
 a short explanation on LFSRs because CS majors don't really talk about them ever.

All repositories could use a standardised contribution guideline to familiarise 
team members with team policies.

### Project Work
- [Onboarding Lab 3](https://github.com/rishyak/potential-computing-machine/tree/main/Labs/3): Completed lab 3 on verification
- [Repo Cleanup](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-processor-design.github.io/pull/12): Cleaned garbage files on repo
- [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-processor-design.github.io/pull/14): Added a Markdown cheatsheet for reference.
- Minor Fixes: Fixed [typos](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-processor-design.github.io/pull/16) and [missing URL's](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-processor-design.github.io/pull/37).

### Comments
I finished the last available onboarding lab at the moment. Verilator-based veri
fication wasn't an issue for me since I have used both, Catch and Verilator before. 
I faced an issue with exercise 3 which was the tiniest, silliest bug. 

Good lab. 

I don't expect people to have their text editors set up to format on save, so 
documentation should probably touch on that as well.

Fixed some tiny things I saw like extraneous files in repositories or typos or 
missing URL's.

# Rishyak's Design Notebook
This is Rishyak, he does processor-designer-ey things.

## Week of January 22, 2023
### Project Work
- [Onboarding Lab 1](https://github.com/rishyak/potential-computing-machine/tree/main/Labs/1): Completed lab 1 on toolchains
- [Onboarding Lab 2](https://github.com/rishyak/potential-computing-machine/tree/main/Labs/2): Completed lab 2 on SystemvVerilog

### Comments
I met the processor design team during orientation on January 23, 2023. 

After much preparation, I started onboarding labs on January 27, 2023. I had 
to upgrade some dependencies but I was familiar with everything for lab 1.

I also finished the second onboarding lab on system verilog. I had to look up 
Fibonacci LFSRs and some Verilog syntax but the rest was fairly straightforward. 
I think it would be convenient if this lab had some more hand-holding. For example, 
a simpler example at the start for a quick revision on Verilog, or perhaps even
 a short explanation on LFSRs because CS majors don't really talk about them ever.

 Good labs.

All repositories could use a standardised contribution guideline to familiarise 
team members with team policies.

## Week of January 29, 2023
### Project Work
- [Onboarding Lab 3](https://github.com/rishyak/potential-computing-machine/tree/main/Labs/3): Completed lab 3 on verification
- [Repo Cleanup](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-processor-design.github.io/pull/12): Cleaned garbage files on repo
- [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-processor-design.github.io/pull/14): Added a Markdown cheatsheet for reference.
- Minor Fixes: Fixed [typos](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-processor-design.github.io/pull/16) and [missing URL's](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-processor-design.github.io/pull/37).

### Comments
I finished the last available onboarding lab at the moment. Verilator-based veri
fication wasn't an issue for me since I have used both, Catch and Verilator before. 
I faced an issue with exercise 3 which was the tiniest, silliest bug. 

Good lab. 

I don't expect people to have their text editors set up to format on save, so 
documentation should probably touch on that as well.

Fixed some tiny things I saw like extraneous files in repositories or typos or 
missing URL's.

### Comments
Finished the last currently available lab on verification toolchains. This was
easier than expected since I did a lot of the adaptation work last week already.
All I had to do was write the toolchains. 

I discovered that the instructions were missing a vital piece of information
which I spoke to teamleiter about. 

Good lab.

I feel iffy about just blindly using `nyu-cmake` and `nyu-util` so I'm gonna 
spend the week looking into that so I don't feel iffy about using them.

Got sick of the GitHub "community health" notifications and decided to make
a `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the entire team to follow.

I also created a VM for team-members looking for a native Linux experience
and a corresponding installation and usage guide.

In my quest to czar the AMBA department, I have finally caught up on all 
backlog so I can dedicate my week to memorising the AMBA manual and looking
into Verilog I know very little about. Shouldn't be too bad.

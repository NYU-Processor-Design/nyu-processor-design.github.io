### Comments
I met the processor design team during orientation on January 23, 2023. 

After much preparation, I started onboarding labs on January 27, 2023. I had to upgrade some dependencies but I was familiar with everything for lab 1.

I also finished the second onboarding lab on system verilog. I had to look up Fibonacci LFSRs and some Verilog syntax but the rest was fairly straightforward. I think it would be convenient if this lab had some more hand-holding. For example, a simpler example at the start for a quick revision on Verilog, or perhaps even a short explanation on LFSRs because CS majors don't really talk about them ever.

All repositories could use a standardised contribution guideline to familiarise team members with team policies.

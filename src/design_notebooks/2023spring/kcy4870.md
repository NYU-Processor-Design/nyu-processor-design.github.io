# Kevin's Design Notebook
----

Hello, this is my design notebook


## Week of 27 January 2023

Project Work:
  * [Onboarding Lab 1](https://github.com/kevincyap/VIP-Onboarding-Labs/tree/master/Lab1): Completed Lab 1 CMake and Toolchains

This week was spent attending the orientation meeting for all members and starting with Onboarding Lab 1. I learned the specifics of what CMake does and how it is used. I have interacted with CMake before but I've never fully understood or interacted with it until now.

I was having some indecisiveness about how to submit the lab report. In particular I wasn't sure how I should submit the lab itself. I decided to create one repository for all of the onboarding labs that I will do in order to keep all my work in a single repository.

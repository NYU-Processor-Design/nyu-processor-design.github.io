# Kevin's Design Notebook
----

Hello, this is my design notebook


## Week of 27 January 2023

Project Work:
  * [Onboarding Lab 1](https://github.com/kevincyap/VIP-Onboarding-Labs/tree/master/Lab1): Completed Lab 1 CMake and Toolchains

This week was spent attending the orientation meeting for all members and starting with Onboarding Lab 1. I learned the specifics of what CMake does and how it is used. I have interacted with CMake before but I've never fully understood or interacted with it until now.

I was having some indecisiveness about how to submit the lab report. In particular I wasn't sure how I should submit the lab itself. I decided to create one repository for all of the onboarding labs that I will do in order to keep all my work in a single repository.

## Week of 3 Feburary 2023

Project Work:
  * [Onboarding Lab 2](https://github.com/kevincyap/onboarding-lab-2): Completed Lab 2 System Verilog

This week I completed the second onboarding lab. I got my first introduction to System Verilog and learned more about how unit tests are made and run. The lab itself didn't take that much time. Instead I spent most of my time trying to figure out how the testing environment worked.

## Week of 10 Feburary 2023

Project Work:
  * [Windows WSL Documentation](../../getting_started/development/03_wsl_vscode.md): Completed first verison of Windows WSL documentation

This week I focused on creating the WSL documentation. I struggled for the first few days because I misunderstood the purpose of this documentation but after a discussion with Vito I was able to finish it in a couple of days. I was slowed down because I did not have a good way of testing my guide since all of my computers already have WSL installed so Vito will be going through this guide and providing feedback on what does and doesn't work.

## Week of 17 Feburary 2023

Project Work:
  * [Onboarding Lab 3](https://github.com/kevincyap/onboarding-lab-3): Completed Lab 3 Verification

  This week I was planning on completing both labs 3 and 4 but was only able to finish lab 3 because I got stuck on some undefined behavior for C++ with bitshifts and modulus. Michael helped a lot by reminding me of an old message he sent about this issue a few weeks back. After he helped me I was able to finish the lab in a couple days without much issue. 

## Week of 24 Feburary 2023
Project Work:
  * [Onboarding Lab 4](https://github.com/kevincyap/onboarding-lab-4/)

  This week I finished Lab 4 which was fairly straight forward. I had some trouble finding time to work on lab work before this weekend so I will be submitting this design notebook a little late.

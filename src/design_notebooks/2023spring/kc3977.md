## Week of 23 January 2023
Project Work: 
* [Onboarding Lab 1] (link/to/repo) Completed Lab 1 
* [Design Notebook] (lik/to/pullrequest) Started repo for the design notebook

Completed Oreintation Lab 1, configured git and GitHub access for use with Anubis 
because my computer recently had a stroke and I don't trust it to hold anything 
even remotely resembling anything that could be somewhat important.

Also started a secondary VIP repo for my work and notebook,
I'm a little bit paranoid since my PC had the aforementioned stroek.

## Week of 23 January 2023
Project Work: 
* [Onboarding Lab 1](https://github.com/kc3977/VIP/tree/master/week_one_lab) Completed Lab 1 
* [Design Notebook](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-processor-design.github.io/pull/10) Started repo for the design notebook

Completed Oreintation Lab 1, configured git and GitHub access for use with Anubis 
because my computer recently had a stroke and I don't trust it to hold anything 
even remotely resembling anything that could be somewhat important.

Also started a secondary VIP repo for my work and notebook,
I'm a little bit paranoid since my PC had the aforementioned stroke.

Playing a little bit of catch-up-ahead, because my availability may get spotty over the next few weeks,
turns out that getting married takes up a lot of time before it actually happens!

Completed Orientation Labs 2 & 3, went fairly smoothly, although I did have to do what is called
a PRO-proGrAMmER-MOVE and did google a lot for syntax and basic terms reasons, 
because I never remeber things when I need them (obviously).

Also have been appointed Project Manager, as the other more different bald person on the team,
I think there's a pattern emerging here...

Another interesting side effect of my computer near death experience is that my minus key is very dead.
I found out when I had to fix code, because none of the keystroke on the - key registered (I hope insert key will not be required moving forward in my life, because it's now rebinded to -).
And the speakers stopped working. And the screen has a purple smudge in the middle, because red and blue
subpixels dont turn off properly.

# Uma Nachiappan's Design Notebook

Welcome to my Spring 2023 design notebook.


## Week of 23 January 2023

Project Work:
* [Onboarding Lab 1](https://github.com/umanachi/vip_lab1): Completed Lab 1

This week, I explored the tools on our Anubis IDE and started understanding more
about how to use git and GitHub. I completed lab 1 from the onboarding series
and learned about toolchains and CMake, and how to implement them to run simple
programs.

I struggled a bit with linking my directories and files created in Anubis to my
GitHub repository, but with a bit of Googling and with help from the VIP website
guides, I was able to push my directory to GitHub and link it above.

I will be unable to complete Lab 2 next week, but I will work on both Lab 2 and
3 during Week 3 (Feb 5-12).

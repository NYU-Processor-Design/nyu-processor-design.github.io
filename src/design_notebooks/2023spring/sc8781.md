# Swarnashri's design notebook

Hello, this is my VIP NYU Processor Design notebook/journal.

# Week of 23 January, 2023
* [Onboarding Lab 1](Link: https://github.com/swarshri/VIP_NYUProcLab1.git): Completed Lab 1.

This week I spent some time going through the VIP Course Notebook, and completed Lab 1. I created a CMakeLists.txt file and sample C++ code files and could build them without any issues. I haven't tried Anubis yet. I will try that out next week along with Lab 2.

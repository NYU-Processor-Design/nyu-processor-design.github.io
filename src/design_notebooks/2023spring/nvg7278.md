This is a teamleiter, it leiters the team

## Week of 23 January 2023

Project Work:

* First three labs more or less done:
  * [Docs for lab 1](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-processor-design.github.io/commit/7061d0209f23bdd6022afa326068f4be901e4920)
  * [Template for lab 2](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/onboarding-lab-2/commit/3b1b402d5721667be2209e1e597a27c981b781e7)
  * [Template for lab 3](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/onboarding-lab-3/commit/ac355f1f057fac2b15ed900f7f2b68de1d731105)

* Most of the initial getting started docs are done, but require more work on
  ironing out practical problems students will run into managing `git` and
  especially fast-forwarding commits from upstream onto their origin repos

* Reviewed and merged DNs from team, some examples of feedback provided:
  * [Uma PR](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-processor-design.github.io/pull/5)
  * [Sean PR](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-processor-design.github.io/pull/7)
  * [Rishyak PR](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-processor-design.github.io/pull/11)

* [Project page for Phase 1](https://github.com/orgs/NYU-Processor-Design/projects/2)
  has some objectives filled in but still needs more concrete guidance on tasking,
  hoping to deligate this stuff out to project czars once the team is more up to
  speed on development process

Still trying to get all the material we need to zero-to-sixty incoming students.
Generating useful lab material is a larger challenge than anticipated but I need
to also keep in mind things that take me minutes will sometimes challenge
students for 30+ minutes or an hour because of large deltas in pre-req knowledge.

Also still working on a good general compute environment. Experimented with
an Anubis playground, but memory and storage limits quickly made it non-viable.
Local development guides are perilous, but might be the only way forward.

## Week of 30 January 2023

Project Work:

* [Developed new test flow](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/component-template/commit/b203d2165fb1f9237e4bcb5524e8271291ea15bf)
* [Created Lab 4](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/onboarding-lab-4)


Reviewed, provided feedback, and merged student labs per usual. Chugging away on
creating labs, hopefully the last few (which involve less tutorial and more
exercises) will go faster.

New test flow is hopefully an improvement, as we move to a single executable/Catch2
managed testing paradigm. Building the codecov report generator as a static lib
might be a mistake, as it requires some build-system hacks and finalizing the
linking provides no benefit. Need to look into building it as an object lib.

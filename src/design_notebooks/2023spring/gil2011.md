## Week of 30 January 2023

Project Work:
* [Onboarding Lab 1](https://github.com/gil92723/Week-1.git): Completed Lab 1

This week was used to complete the onboarding lab for week 1.

I am a bit behind on labs and may have to speed up, but I got a bit stuck on part 2 and 3 because the separate include and src directories caused some sort of error that I couldn’t figure out. I was also confused on how to see any output. Below are some other notes I took during the lab.
 
Lab 1 notes

* had difficulty figuring out what directory was at first and then was confused on what exactly to do to have the directory show up in the console, but I figured it out eventually!!
successfully printed out “Hello World”
* for part 2 I learned:
  * add_executable() will introduce a new program to be created
  * target_sources([new name] PRIVATE [file used.cpp]) will be the source file used with this new program
* had some trouble figuring out how to actually run the new files that I made with name.hpp and name.cpp …
* Questions I had:
*   when would you need a meta-build system?
*   is part 2 supposed to produce any output?
 
## Week of 20 Feb 2023

Had a busy week so only had time to read through lab 3 and brush up on more verilog. Might plan to come up with a list of topics I'm unsure of and run through them with someone soon!

## Week of 27 Feb 2023

Project work:
* [Onboarding Lab 2](https://github.com/gil92723/onboarding-lab-2.git): Completed Lab 2

I actually finished this lab a while ago and literally just forgot that I didn't test it... This week I sat down, installed homebrew, and had LOTS of fun learning how to properly use homebrew and how to test this lab. I didn't realize that I didn't have cmake installed or whatever is needed to run verilog stuff locally. Thankfully, Nicky K helped me out with the testing stuff using cmake and a friend from home helped yell at me until I learned homebrew and cmake fully (thumbs up, def wasn't abused into obtaining knowledge) :)

I feel much more comfortable with github and verilog, as well as just identifying what exactly it is I struggle with/how to explain what I need help with to people!!

## Week of 6 Mar 2023

Project work:
* [Onboarding Lab 3](https://github.com/gil92723/onboarding-lab-3.git): Completed Lab 3

Lab 3 consisted of me staring at the test cases from lab 2 and trying to learn and implement them myself. I think I have a good handle on how to start a test case, but I think I may need a little bit more time to understand how to make sure when the test case is messed up vs when the program is messed up.

## Week of 20 Mar 2023

Project work:
* Working on lab 4 and finishing up last portions
* Reading up on core and CPU

Took a bit of a break last week and so forgot to pull request literally anything. Getting back on track this week but getting slightly behind due to some personal stress and work overload.

## Week of 27 Mar 2023

Project work:
* [Onboarding Lab 4](https://github.com/gil92723/onboarding-lab-4.git): Completed Lab 4 (finally...)
* Began taking note of documentation issues raised in the nyu-core and connecting with Uma and Michael to know what to do.
* [CPU General Purpose Registers](https://github.com/gil92723/nyu-core/blob/51352f844e05e11fb531a43f4f41c34609895086/module_functionality/00_CPU_general_purpose_registers.md) documentation completed.
* [IF/ID Latch](https://github.com/gil92723/nyu-core/blob/51352f844e05e11fb531a43f4f41c34609895086/module_functionality/01_IF_ID_latch.md) documentation completed.

I'm starting to work on documentation issues with Uma and Michael and figuring out what exactly I have to do now that I've finished uploading and fixing all my lab work. I also fixed up the formatting of my design notebook because it was _**ugly**_ :) I had to review markdown to make everything pretty but overall I would say it's actually really fun to do and organizing everything helps me review how the processor works as well.

## Week of 3 Apr 2023

Project work:
* [ID/EX Latch](https://github.com/gil92723/nyu-core/blob/74b0cf3105e0532e48b7c58869802cf8e0e9f682/module_functionality/02_ID_EX_Latch.md) Documentation completed
* Planned out to work on a presentation with Uma for Markdown, Github stuff, and documentation
* Edited [CPU General Purpose Registers](https://github.com/gil92723/nyu-core/blob/51352f844e05e11fb531a43f4f41c34609895086/module_functionality/00_CPU_general_purpose_registers.md) and [IF/ID Latch](https://github.com/gil92723/nyu-core/blob/51352f844e05e11fb531a43f4f41c34609895086/module_functionality/01_IF_ID_latch.md) docs with some tables to improve readability. (I learned how to do tables for Markdown while doing this!!)

Lowkey a slower week because I was swamped by my club's events, but I still got some stuff done and I know exactly what to do for the following week at the very least! I'll be working on the presentation with Uma, working on more NYU Core docs, and I might look more into doing core implementations as well because I don't exactly know how to get started with it :D

## Week of 10 Apr 2023

Project work:
* [Docs Template](https://github.com/gil92723/nyu-core/blob/5e69daf2408a299ef6d88af0abf6836bfe90b7e7/module_functionality/doc_template.md) Documentation template completed
* [EX/MEM Latch](https://github.com/gil92723/nyu-core/blob/5e69daf2408a299ef6d88af0abf6836bfe90b7e7/module_functionality/03_EX_MEM_Latch.md) Documentation completed
* [MEM/WB Latch](https://github.com/gil92723/nyu-core/blob/5e69daf2408a299ef6d88af0abf6836bfe90b7e7/module_functionality/04_MEM_WB_Latch.md) Documentation completed
* [General Control Module](https://github.com/gil92723/nyu-core/blob/5e69daf2408a299ef6d88af0abf6836bfe90b7e7/module_functionality/05_General_Control_Module.md) Documentation file created; not completed as there is not yet a formal outline
* [Branch Evaluator](https://github.com/gil92723/nyu-core/blob/5e69daf2408a299ef6d88af0abf6836bfe90b7e7/module_functionality/06_Branch_Evaluator.md) Documentation completed

As per Michael's genius suggestion, I created a documentation template that, as you can see, really sped up the documentation flow. I'm pretty sick as I'm writing this so I'm looking to a pretty low work week as I recover from the excrutiating joint pain that is making even typing hard for me. But in between the ouch I will try to work on the presentation with Uma and begin looking/working on the branch address calculator that Michael has recently assigned to me! All in all, despite my own health issues, I would say that I'm really proud of the work I was able to do this past week!

## Week of 17 Apr 2023

Project work:
* Edited some module documentation for extra consistency after Michael did a little updating

As a lot of the files made were basically empty files, I got a **lot** more work done than I had anticipated given that I'm in excruciating pain LOL. Looking to start the branch address calculator soon and finishing up the presentation with Uma.

## Week of 24 Apr 2023

Project work:
* Finished Markdown/Github presentation with Uma
* Began to read about branch address calculator and what needs to be done to try and get started.

I talked to Michael about working on the branch address calculator, and I don't quite think that I'll have it done amidst finals and projects running full speed at me. However, I will continue to be editing docs and outlining what I need to do with it in between study time!

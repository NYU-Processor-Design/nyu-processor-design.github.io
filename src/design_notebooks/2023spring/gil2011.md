Onboarding Lab 1([Link](https://github.com/gil92723/Week-1.git)): Completed Lab 1
This week was used to complete the onboarding lab for week 1.

I am a bit behind on labs and may have to speed up, but I got a bit stuck on part 2 and 3 because the separate include and src directories caused some sort of error that I couldn’t figure out. I was also confused on how to see any output. Below are some other notes I took during the lab.

Lab 1 notes

* had difficulty figuring out what directory was at first and then was confused on what exactly to do to have the directory show up in the console, but I figured it out eventually!!
successfully printed out “Hello World”
* for part 2 I learned:
  * add_executable() will introduce a new program to be created
  * target_sources([new name] PRIVATE [file used.cpp]) will be the source file used with this new program
* had some trouble figuring out how to actually run the new files that I made with name.hpp and name.cpp …
* Questions I had:
*   when would you need a meta-build system?
*   is part 2 supposed to produce any output?

## Week of 6 Feb 2023

* Began Onboarding Lab 2 but did not complete. I found I was unfamiliar with LFSR and forgot some Verilog syntax so I reached out to the group for some guidance.

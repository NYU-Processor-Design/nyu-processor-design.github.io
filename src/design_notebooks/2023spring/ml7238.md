## Week of January 23, 2023

Project Work:
* [Onboarding Lab 1](https://github.com/ShinyMiraidon/Chip-VIP-Team-Lab-1): Completed Lab 1
* [Onboarding Lab 2](https://github.com/ShinyMiraidon/Chip-VIP-Team-Lab-2): Completed Lab 2


This week was spent mostly on completing onboarding labs 1 and 2. I worked by myself to complete these onboarding labs. I also opened two issue reports about mistakes in the labs and they were resolved.


Both labs were a good post break refresh on the basics of cmake, make, and verilog. 

## Week of January 30, 2023

Project Work:
* [Onboarding Lab 3](https://github.com/ShinyMiraidon/Chip-VIP-Team-Lab-3): Completed Lab 3
* [Docs for Homebrew](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-processor-design.github.io/pull/25): Created documentation for using Homebrew on Mac to install the required dependencies for the onboarding labs


This week was spent mostly on completing onboarding lab 3 with some time also spent on creating the Homebrew documentation. Overall, Lab 3 was very informative and helped me to better understand how to use C++ to test verilog modules.


For the Homebrew documentation, I had previous experience using Markdown but this was a good review and it was very helpful in understanding the structure of the website as I had to create a new section to add the documentation to (after trying to simply insert it into the lab section with poor results).


For the future, I want to add more explanations to the Homebrew guide about what the commands do as well as other useful features of homebrew that may be relevant for this project.

## Week of February 6, 2023

Project Work:
* [Onboarding Lab 4](https://github.com/ShinyMiraidon/Chip-VIP-Team-Lab-4): Completed Lab 4
* [Fixed Spelling Errors](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-processor-design.github.io/pull/35): Fixed spelling errors in onboarding documentation


This week was spent mostly on completing onboarding lab 4. Lab 4 introduced a lot of new concepts and was very helpful in getting a better understanding of the toolchaoin we will be using. I did run into a few issues with CMake but Vito was able to help me out with the first issue and I resolved the other issues by switching from the GCC 12.2.0 kit to the Clang 14.0.0 kit. 


I also took some time this week to fix formatting errors and spelling mistakes in the onboarding documentation.

## Week of 15 Feb 2026

Project Work:
* Had a team meeting this week,
* Went over the NYU Processor Design Team SoC CPU Core report

Notes on the report:
* The overall design of the CPU is a 32 bit CPU using the RISC-V 32 instruction set
* It has a regular 5 stage pipeline like we took in comparch
* It uses a 2 bit branch predictor
* Its data cache is 2 way associative
* A question I have is if a different type of branch predictor would improve the performance of the CPU, specificially something more advanced, and what tradeoffs implementing something like that would have
* Why don't we use data forwarding when the hazard detection stalls the pipeline using NOPs?

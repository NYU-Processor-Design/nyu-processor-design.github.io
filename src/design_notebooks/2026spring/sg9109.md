# Srijan Gupta's Design Notebook

## Week 1 (01/25/26 - 02/01/26)

- Attended the introductory meeting.
- Went through the setup instructions, since I use a Linux machine and have designed hardware before, I did not have to make many changes.
- Was unable to get to the onboarding labs this week but will work more over the next week(s).

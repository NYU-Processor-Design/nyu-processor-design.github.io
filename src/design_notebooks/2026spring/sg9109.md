# Srijan Gupta's Design Notebook

## Week 1 (01/26/26 - 02/01/26)

- Attended the introductory meeting.
- Went through the setup instructions, since I use a Linux machine and have designed hardware before, I did not have to make many changes.
- Was unable to get to the onboarding labs this week but will work more over the next week(s).

## Week 2 (02/02/26 - 02/08/26)

- I completed the first three onboarding labs, which are linked [here](https://github.com/Srijan1972/Onboarding-Labs).
- I aim to complete more of the onboarding labs next week.

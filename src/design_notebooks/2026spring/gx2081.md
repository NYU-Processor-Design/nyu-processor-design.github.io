## Week One (1/26-2/1)
This week, I attended the group meeting and gained a basic understanding of what I will be doing for the semester. I connected with a groupmate for the onboarding project, worked through the setup instructions through Part 3, and submitted this update as my first pull request.

## Week Two (2/2-2/8)
• Met with my groupmate (Tony) to coordinate work on the onboarding project.
• Completed Onboarding Lab 1.
• Began the RISC-16 onboarding project ([risk16-onboarding](https://github.com/tonykorycki/risk16-onboarding)) and completed Module 1.

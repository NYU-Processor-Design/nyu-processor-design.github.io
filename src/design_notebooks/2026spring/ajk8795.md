## Week 1: 01/25-02/01/2026

- Read the syllabus and sections 1-4 on the VIP's website
- Installed all required extensions and set up my VM through VirtualBox
- Found a partner (Gloria) for the RiSC-16 onboarding project and we scheduled our first meeting for Friday 
- Read the slides fo the onboarding project and the ones from the first in-person meeting

I already had WSL set up and was familiar with using Git so I didnt run into many issues getting started. The website was very clear and easy to follow.

# Noah Mays-Smith's Design Notebook

## Week One:
### This Week I:
- Held an informational meeting for all members. I was focused on onboarding information
- Set up new members with their RiSC-16 project teams, and created groupchats with all teams. These chats included Ghala for attendence. Chats are meant to allow me to check in on teams for attendance, figure out when their team meetings are, and share any information specific to the team
- Organized GitHub with the help of Ghala to better define who is who. New roles are "First Semester" "Current Members" and "Current Leadership." These roles will allow us to better use the discord and the @ feature.
- Rewrote the Instruction Memory and PC informational slideshows into one starting assignment. This assignment strongly guides new members on their path. As modules progress, they will give less of a helping hand.
- Attended Biweekly meetings with co-leaders (Wednesday and Thursday) to ensure team is on the right track

### Notes:
- There are some issues with members Mohamed and Yvette joining the team. They missed the first meeting, failed to join the discord on time, and are missing a lot of key information. I will try to bring them up to speed in the coming weeks.

## Week Two:
### This week I:
- Rewrote the ALU and Data Memory informational slideshows into one assignment. This assignment still guides the viewer along the path of creating the module, but gives more freedom and refers back to earlier information more instead of directly saying how to do an assignment.
- Attended biweekly meetings with co-leaders to ensure team is on the right track

### Notes:
- Still struggling with getting Mohamed and Yvette up to speed. They are in the Discord, but are not responding to friend requests, so I cannot make the group chat for attendance and give them the attention they need to get back on pace with the rest of the group.

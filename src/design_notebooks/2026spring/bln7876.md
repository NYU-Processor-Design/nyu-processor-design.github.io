# Bao's Design Notebook

## Week of January 26th
### Team Meeting
* January 28th: I attended the first team meeting on campus.
* I familiarized myself with the VIP's syllabus.
* I examined the RiSC-16's [sequential implementation](https://user.eng.umd.edu/~blj/RiSC/RiSC-seq.pdf) and [instruction-set architecture](https://user.eng.umd.edu/~blj/RiSC/RiSC-isa.pdf).
* I partnered up with [Tim](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-processor-design.github.io/blob/main/src/design_notebooks/2026spring/tc3956.md) to start the RiSC-16 onboarding project.
  * We set weekly meeting time at 2 P.M. every Monday.

## Week of February 2nd
### RiSC-16 Onboarding Project
* A Github repo of the RiSC-16 onboarding project was created and shared with [Noah](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-processor-design.github.io/blob/main/src/design_notebooks/2026spring/nm4207.md).
* February 7th: [Tim](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-processor-design.github.io/blob/main/src/design_notebooks/2026spring/tc3956.md) and I finished the two modules of Assignment 2 of the onboarding project, collaborating using Live Share extension on Virtual Studio Code.
  * We implemented the instruction memory and program counter.
  * Flu-like viral infection restricted me and [Tim](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-processor-design.github.io/blob/main/src/design_notebooks/2026spring/tc3956.md) from meeting at intended time.

## Week of February 9th
### RiSC-16 Onboarding Project
* February 10th and February 11th: [Tim](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-processor-design.github.io/blob/main/src/design_notebooks/2026spring/tc3956.md) and I finished the two modules of Assignment 2 of the onboarding project, collaborating using Live Share extension on Virtual Studio Code.
  * We implemented the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) and data memory.
  * Post-illness fatigue restricted me and [Tim] from finishing the assignment in one meeting, so we splitted into two meetings.

## Week of February 16th
### RiSC-16 Onboarding Project
* February 16th and February 18th: [Tim](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-processor-design.github.io/blob/main/src/design_notebooks/2026spring/tc3956.md) and I finished the two modules of Assignment 3 of the onboarding project, collaborating using Live Share extension on Virtual Studio Code.
  * We implemented the register file and control. We also ensured every positive clock edge write to the correct location in memory.
  * We were able to meet at the intended time; however, time constraints and conflicts necessitate to finish this in two separate meetings.
### Team Meeting
* February 18th: I attended the second team meeting on Zoom due to delaying MTA trains.

## Week of February 23rd
* February 23rd: [Tim](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-processor-design.github.io/blob/main/src/design_notebooks/2026spring/tc3956.md) and I finished the module of Assignment 4 of the onboarding project, collaborating using Live Share extension on Virtual Studio Code.
  * We implemented the ALU testbench. We also wondered whether a dedicated folder should be created for testbenches.
  * Another module (Sixth RiSC-16 Module:
Control Module) of the onboarding project was included in the assignment slides, ofwhich not much information was shared. We henceforth decided not to accomplish it for now.
  * We were able to meet at the intended time.

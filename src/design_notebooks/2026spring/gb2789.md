Ghala's Design Notebook: Processor Design VIP
-
## Week1: 01/20/26 - 01/25/26
- Had two meeting with the leadership team.
- Discussed: Gradebook, syllabus, first meeting of the semester, goals for the VIP, meeting times, ... etc.
- Getting to know what my role as part of the management team entails and the expectations.

**Discussion:** looking forward for this semester and the goals we're going to achieve.

## Week2: 01/26/26 - 02/01/26
- Did small improvements on the Discord server.
- Created a gradebook for the VIP.
- Had our first all members meeting for the semester.
- Discussed what the returning members are expected to do with Darren and the other returning members.

**Discussion:** I already have done 1-4 Onboarding labs last semster but I found 3-4 Labs to be a little confusing so I went over them again and tried to understand them better. I haven't created new files or folders but intend to create a folder specified for the onboarding labs once I start with Lab 5.

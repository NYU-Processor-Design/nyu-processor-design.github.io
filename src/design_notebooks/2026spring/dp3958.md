- Attended the VIP meeting from 6–7 PM on Wednesday.
- Learned more about Git through a presentation given at the meeting.
- Resolved an issue with my pull requests — with help from the team, I deleted my old branch and created a new branch containing all previous design notebooks.

**Discussion:** Finding out my pull requests were set up incorrectly was a good learning moment — cleaning it up by starting fresh with a properly structured branch was the move.

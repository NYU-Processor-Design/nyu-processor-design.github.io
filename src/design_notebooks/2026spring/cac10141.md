# Calvin's Design Notebook

## Week of February 15th
* Caught up on requirements and updates from the team meeting as I'm unable to make Wednesday meetings
* Read through both Design and Construction of RTL Toolchains at NYU and NYU Processor Design Team SoC CPU Core
* Created documents for a second read through to take notes on (I typically like to read an entire passage first and then take notes after)
* Will plan for this upcoming design notebook to take notes on documents and share them

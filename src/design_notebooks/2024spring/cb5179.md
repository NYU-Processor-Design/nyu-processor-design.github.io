# **Design Notebook for Cameron Bedard**

## Week of Feb 5th:
- Added to the Github and read through the Course Documents and Getting Started section of the VIP website. Looked up and familiarized myself with termanology I did not know. Sought help from the team making my first pull request to create this notebook.

## Week of Feb 12th:
- Started working through the Onboarding Labs. Downloaded and booted my VM from the provided OVA file.
- Worked on getting C++ wokring on my pirmary Windows OS as well. Had a error when trying to run code which led me to  troubleshoot for two days before fixing a PATH issue with the compiler I installed. It was a good learning experince as far as how installing a compiler works and how VS Code works. A little futile considering all the work will be done on Linux but learned something none the less.
- Finished setting up my Linux VM and completed Lab 1.
- Started work on Lab 2.

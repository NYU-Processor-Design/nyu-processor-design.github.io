# Design Notebook for Kevin Guo (2024 Spring)

## Week of 6 Feburary 2024
Project Work:
* [Design Notebook]: Design Notebook created

I learned commands in git and created my own design notebook and did my first pull request.

I should use git to commit changes instead of creating new files on github. This is not enough for most of the projects I am going to do in the team. I also put the notebook in wrong position. However, rishyak fixed them for me.

* [Onboarding Lab1] ([link/to/repo](https://github.com/hg2622/Lab1)): Completed Lab 1.

I had trouble downloading Brew but eventually I got it from its website. I also download the github desktop, it's very conviniennt. I had trouble building the program because I did not save it. But everything worked out fine after I figure those small things out.

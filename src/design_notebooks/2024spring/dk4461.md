# Darren's Design Notebook

## Week of February 2nd, 2024

### Project Work

* Created Design notebook for Spring 2024

#### Comments
This was a good refesher of how to use git, and work with repos, and forks. Also had to spend some time getting WSL to run again after running into issues with Hyper-V on my system.

### Project Work

* Completed Onboarding [Lab 1](https://github.com/dareminion/proc-design-Lab-1)

#### Comments

* When working on the forked repository I need to remember to create a branch first.
* Asked Vito for some basic help with fixing the mistake of not making a branch first as well as fixing a Cmake issue in Lab 1.
* Rishyak helped with locating a compiler issue which was just needing to install gcc/g++

## Week of March 1st, 2024

### Project Work

* Started Lab 3 Exercise 1

#### Comments

* Asked Vito during weekly meeting about how to start writing a test for Module 1 which tested simple logic
* Ran into some issues with the for loop inside of the test
* Will make neater for loops in the future, or avoid them when possible

## Week of March 8th, 2024

### Project Work

* Continued Lab 3 Exercise 1

#### Comments

* After getting the for loops to run, there were still comparison errors with the logic of the tests
* Troubleshooting with Vito resulted in some variable declaration issues in C++
* This took way too long

## Week of March 15th, 2024

### Project Work

* Finished Lab 3 [Exercise 1](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/onboarding-lab-3/commit/3c4739cafb026a2197bfbd29fbf180c61d702722)

#### Comments

* Commit above includes Exercise 2, I need to get in the habit of commiting more often
* Even though these labs are primarily done locally, commiting more often would allow for ease of work from multiple locations

## Week of March 29th

### Project Work

* Started Lab 3 Exercise 2
    * Same commit as from the previous week due to my git incompetence

#### Comments

* Vito gave me a quick lesson on how to get the value of a bit by shifting it and then "anding" it
    * `uint16_t val = (model.out >> 0) & 1;`
* Learned how to test a register without going through every possible value, rather by testing each bit of the register
* While test is running and passing, the test could be more comprehensive

## Week of April 5th

### Project Work

* Update ReadME for [Lab 2](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/onboarding-lab-2/commit/1edbc795b286146f185f8bd3ca507ec079b8dbdc)
* Update ReadME for [Lab 3](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/onboarding-lab-3/commit/9ca3e0de67b53b99ad33551860dea85c3645f43f)

#### Comments
* Just needed to fill out the ReadMe for Lab 2
* While Lab 3 is still unfinished, I was able to answer part of the ReadME and thought I would update it alongside Lab 2

## Week of April 12th

### Project Work

* Research into what OpenRAM is
* Went through the Git Repo for [OpenRAM](https://github.com/VLSIDA/OpenRAM)
* Watched a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr3U2Nz-UIc) on a presentation on OpenRAM

#### Comments

* I never quite understood what I was looking at, other than that OpenRAM is a memory compilier, and can produce a file for SPICE simulators to use
* Stumbled upon a Cornell Grad Git page on OpenRAM simulation, showed me what OpenRAM can generate, which was quite interesting

## Week of April 19th

### Project Work

* Look at the AMBA repo for the AHB Doc
* Looked at some of the registers/databus information, got confused, and read some more
* Understood that the Memory communicates with the AHB subordinate

## Week of April 26th

### Project Work

* Work on my on presentation

#### Comments

* Michael's presenation was very informative, taught me more about the VIP and the Core team

* Brief discussion with Vito about memory, and how it communicates with the AHB using `Generic`

#### Comments

* This semester has been significantly more eventful than the last, I learned more this semester
    * Actually asking for help is good
    * I learned Verilog, Digital Logic really did not teach me much
    * While taking a Class in C this semester, it has helped me understand more of C++
    * Writing simple verification tests in C++
* Great time at the meetings with help on the labs and just great people to talk to all around
* Looking forward to next semester when I embark on my memory journey

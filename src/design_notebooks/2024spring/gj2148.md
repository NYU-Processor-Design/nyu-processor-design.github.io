### Work done
- [Design notebook task]: was granted access to the repository and opened a pull request for this update.
### Working comments
I decided to join the processor design team after a discussion with professor Dey on my interest in a deeper understanding of computers' mechanisms. Due to my existing committments in the CS undergraduate research course, I have decided to enroll in the VIP with zero credits to familiarize myself with the work. However, I am particularly interested in optimizations and will aim to applying my theoretical / higher-level programming knowledge. Of course, I remain open to learning new things about hardware.

- [AMBA] Writing the testbench for the AHB decoder
### Comments
I met some difficulties trying to compile the testbench. After consulting Rishyak, I updated some of my packages and was able to get the executable. The tests weren't successful so I'm trying to debug.

- [AMBA] Fixing the testbench and the decoder
### Comments
I was able to fix through the testbench with the help from Rishyak, got rid of some unnecessary lines of code and replaced them with more concise functions provided by nyu-util such as nyu::reset() and nyu::tick(). I'm currently fixing some bugs with the address calculation in the AHB Simple Decoder module.

- Readig AMBA specs for designing the AHB-APB bridge
### Comments
Turns out that the problem with the decoder testbench was defect on ahb.addr instead of implementation of SimpleDecoder.sv, reported the problem to Rishyak.
I'm currently reading the APB file and AMBA spec file to design the AHB-APB bridge.

# Week of February 12, 2024
Project Work:
  * Finished (Onboarding Lab 2)[https://github.com/Auryny268/onboarding-lab-2]
  * Worked on Onboarding Lab 3 - (WIP)[https://github.com/Auryny268/onboarding-lab-3]

I enrolled late into the course so this is my first design notebook entry. 

I got really stuck on Onboarding Lab 3: I have the general idea of how each test should be implemented but got really wrapped up in the details. I kept trying to think of ways to write my code cleaner (despite not yet having the tools to do so), which really slowed me down. I've also been learning how the models work through the tests written for Onboarding Lab 2, plus a lot of trial and error.

This upcoming week, I'm gonna try to finish Onboarding Lab 3 and Onboarding Lab 4. I'm not sure how much further I'll get since I'm also quite ill right now.

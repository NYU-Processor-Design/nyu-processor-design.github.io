# Rielle's Spring 2024 Design Notebook
## Week of January 29, 2024
### Project Work
- Core Team Startup: Created a getting started doc to help new members navigate the repo and how to contribute to nyu core!
### Comments
I'll link the doc once the PR is merged but this week was mostly this and checking in to see if there is any finance stuff to do :)
Going to have to get to know more members to decide on a junior finance person with the team soon too so there's that.
Currently now open to working on some core issues which have progressed a heck of a lot more than when I was last on here, so I'm gonna need to take some time to refamiliarize myself with the issues listed.

### Comments
I am bad at reading comprehension and only finally understood what was asked of me 4 days after assignment. Got a couple of new assignments given to me by both Michael and for some reason Rishyak to whittle down on. Currently working on updating module docs.

- Reorganized the Getting Started docs for better flow and clarity
### Comments
Currently working with Uma to refresh and reword the getting started docs so that members can better understand how to navigate through the github and contribute in a more orderly fashion.
Gonna get started with the general control module that Michael assigned to me once I finished midterms.

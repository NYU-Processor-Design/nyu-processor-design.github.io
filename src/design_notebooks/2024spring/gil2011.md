# Rielle's Spring 2024 Design Notebook
## Week of January 29, 2024
### Project Work
- Core Team Startup: Created a getting started doc to help new members navigate the repo and how to contribute to nyu core!
### Comments
I'll link the doc once the PR is merged but this week was mostly this and checking in to see if there is any finance stuff to do :)
Going to have to get to know more members to decide on a junior finance person with the team soon too so there's that.
Currently now open to working on some core issues which have progressed a heck of a lot more than when I was last on here, so I'm gonna need to take some time to refamiliarize myself with the issues listed.

I am bad at reading comprehension and only finally understood what was asked of me 4 days after assignment. Got a couple of new assignments given to me by both Michael and for some reason Rishyak to whittle down on. Currently working on updating module docs.

Currently working with Uma to refresh and reword the getting started docs so that members can better understand how to navigate through the github and contribute in a more orderly fashion.
Gonna get started with the general control module that Michael assigned to me once I finished midterms.

- Rewrote/Reformatted [Getting Started](https://github.com/NYU-Processor-Design/nyu-processor-design.github.io/tree/afc2c3ede22452f365ee232e8e1e38fabd6594a7/src/getting_started) documents; Especially the document on repo navigation
- Began discussing and planning the end of semester presentation with Uma; Topics have been decided upon and outlined.
### Comments
After working with Cameron last week and listening to some questions that were raised in the meeting, Uma and I devised better formatting and ideas that needed more highlighting/explanation. This will hopefully be a much better foundation for the future of the team.

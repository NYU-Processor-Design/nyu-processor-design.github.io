## Week of 10 October 2022

Project Work:
  * [Onboarding Lab 5](link/to/repo): Completed Lab 5, worked with Jerry and
    Rishyak

  * [Doc Workflow Update](link/to/pull_request): Updated the documentation
    workflow, docs are now generated in ~5 seconds instead of 3-4 minutes

This week was mostly spent on lab 5 from the onboarding series. I worked in
close collaboration with Jerry and Rishyak to complete a suite of system
verilog modules that interoperated to solve the lab objectives.

We struggled with the lab's description "interfaces" and what their
applications were. After a discussion with Prof. Epstein, we gained a better
idea of how to apply interfaces to collect related signals together when
connecting components in a top level module. However, our solution to the
lab doesn't make extensive use of interfaces right now.

**Vito's Office Hours**

My office hours are shared with other classes, who will take priority over
VIP students. That said, my office hours aren't busy 90% of the time so don't
hesitate to drop in if you have a question. Email or ping me in the discord
to drop into my personal meeting room.

## Course Prerequisites

Students must be pursuing their undergraduate or graduate degree at NYU in order
to enroll in a VIP course. Enrollment is based on a rolling application process
through the course website. Decisions on acceptance to the course will be made
by the faculty advisors. New student decisions are made by the beginning of each
semester. Students may apply to various VIP course options (i.e., VIP teams),
then select one VIP team to participate on for three consecutive semesters.

***For the Processor Design team:*** Applicants should have completed CS-UY 2214
or ECE-UY 2204 or have equivalent experience with RTL design. Team participation
assumes familiarity with Verilog and associated tooling.

## About VIP

The Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP) Program operates in a research and
development context. Students join VIP teams by enrolling for credit each
semester for their participation in design/discovery efforts that assist faculty
and graduate students with research and development issues in their areas of
expertise.
The teams are:
  * *Multidisciplinary* -- drawing students from all disciplines on campus
  * *Vertically-integrated* -- maintaining a mix of sophomores through PhD
    students each semester
  * *Long-term* -- each undergraduate student may participate in a project for
    up to three years and each graduate student may participate for the duration
    of their graduate career

The continuity, disciplinary depth, and professional breadth of these teams
intend to:
  * Provide the time and context necessary for students to learn and practice
    many different professional skills, make substantial technical contributions
    to the project, and experience many different roles on a large,
    multidisciplinary design/discovery team
  * Support long-term interaction between the graduate and undergraduate
    students on the team. The graduate students mentor the undergraduates as
    they work on the design/discovery projects embedded in the graduate
    students' research
  * Enable the completion of large-scale design/discovery projects that are of
    significant benefit to faculty members' research programs

## Project Objectives

This course operates as an engineering-focused team, research and learning
objectives are achieved through _building_. Team members will be working
collaboratively with industry-standard methodology and modern tooling to
construct novel microprocessor designs. This VIP course coordinates with the
NYU Tandon School of Engineering and the Purdue University SoCET team.

The team has a special focus on modularity of design, toolchain implementation,
continuous integration, testing and verification, test coverage reporting, and
module packaging. Team members should expect to develop a familiarity with all
of these areas prior to developing a specialization.

## Learning Objectives

The team seeks to attain the following outcomes for participants:

  * an ability to identify, compartmentalize, and structure solutions to complex
    problems in digital design using sets of modular components

  * an ability to design and implement repeatable and robust toolchains and
    workflows using industry-standard tooling

  * an ability to collaborate effectively with team members and integrate
    diverse, distributed work into a single cohesive solution

  * an ability to independently research and consider possible solutions to a
    problem space and present concise recommendations for evaluation

## Project Structure

This VIP team does not have designated sub-teams. A single team-wide meeting
will be held weekly at a time determined by participant schedules.

## Course Topics

A short list of topics team members will become familiar with:

  * System Verilog
  * C/C++ for Verification
  * Toolchain Automation
  * Processor pipelining and pipeline stage implementation
  * Caching
  * Design flow tooling
  * Elements of a PDK
  * RISC-V ISA

## Course Structure

### Time

Students attend weekly meetings and work outside of those meetings
individually and/or with team members. The time commitment expected from each
undergraduate student is commensurate with the level of variable credit
enrollment:

1 credit: 4 hours per week

2 credits[^note1]: 8 hours per week

3 credits[^note2]: 12 hours per week

[^note1]: VIP Advisor pre-approval required.

[^note2]: VIP Management pre-approval required.

Graduate students enroll for 1.5 credits, commensurate with 50 hours over the
semester.

**Zero-credit enrollment:** Students may enroll in VIP for zero (0) credits on
a case-by-case basis to address issues of enrollment limitations (e.g., credit
limits). This enrollment option can only be used up to 2 times.


### Weekly Meetings

Each VIP team determines regular team and/or sub-team meeting times during which
students discuss project updates, work on tasks, and plan upcoming objectives.
Weekly meetings generally take place for 1 hour.

Students are responsible for participating in their team and sub-team meetings.
Contact the VIP Student Leadership and/or VIP Advisor prior to missing a meeting
to be excused from attendance. If you miss any meeting, you are responsible for
knowing what occurred in that meeting (typically by discussing it with a team
member). An excused absence does not relieve you of that responsibility.

### Communication

Students are expected to communicate with team members during weekly meetings
and through mid-week exchanges. Students are expected to respond to
communications in an appropriate time frame and to communicate respectfully.
Reach out to VIP team leadership with any issues concerning miscommunication.

**The NYU Processor Design team** coordinates via Github issues, pull request
comments, and our Discord.

### VIP Notebook

Every VIP student maintains documentation consisting of meeting notes, details
about their work and progress, lists of responsibilities, tasks, and deadlines,
reflections, etc.

The notebook format for **the Processor Design team** is markdown documents
submitted as pull requests to this repository. Feedback will be provided in the
pull request, and timeliness is judged based on when a PR is submitted.

Team members are expected to update their notebooks weekly. An accepted PR
represents full credit for the purposes of grading.

It is not the intent that notebooks represent solely individual work. This is
not a test, members' individual knowledge is not under consideration. Group
efforts on labs, developing documentation, or achieving individual or team-wide
objectives are all acceptable work for the purposes of the VIP design notebook.

## Required Materials

There are no required materials for this course. Introductory project
information, training, and resources will be made available to students.

## Grades

Students are graded based on participation, contribution, and documentation.
Attendance is expected at weekly meetings, and every student reports their
individual contributions on a weekly basis through the VIP Notebook.
